## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

This story establishes comprehensive threat modeling foundation as specified in [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md] privacy-first principles and builds upon the security infrastructure established in Stories 0.5-0.6 to systematically identify and document all attack vectors against reproductive health data.

### Previous Story Insights

From Stories 0.5-0.6 completion:

- **CI/CD Security Foundation**: Comprehensive security scanning, vulnerability detection, and supply-chain security implemented
- **SLSA Level 2 Compliance**: Build provenance, artifact signing, and SBOM generation provide attack surface reduction
- **Multi-layered Security**: Defense-in-depth approach with encryption at rest, transit, and application layer
- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: Client-side encryption with server never accessing plaintext data established
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Privacy-first development practices and data handling procedures implemented

Key Lessons:

- Zero-knowledge architecture requires comprehensive threat modeling to ensure no data leakage vectors
- Reproductive health data sensitivity requires culturally-aware threat assessment
- Multi-platform deployment (web, mobile) expands attack surface requiring systematic analysis
- Supply-chain security controls need integration with threat model risk assessments

### Key Technical Details

**STRIDE Framework Application** [Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md]

STRIDE analysis must cover all system components established in architecture:

- **Spoofing**: WebAuthn/Passkey authentication, device identification, service impersonation
- **Tampering**: CryptoEnvelope integrity, database RLS policies, WASM crypto-core validation
- **Repudiation**: Healthcare sharing audit trails, data export logging, user consent tracking
- **Information Disclosure**: Log sanitization, error message filtering, metadata leakage prevention
- **Denial of Service**: Rate limiting (100 req/min per IP, 1000/hour per user) _[Verification Required: Confirm against actual infrastructure]_, resource exhaustion
- **Elevation of Privilege**: RLS policy bypass, cross-user data access, service account escalation

**Zero-Knowledge Threat Model** [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md]

Zero-knowledge architecture requires special threat considerations:

- Client-side encryption must prevent all server-side plaintext access
- Metadata analysis attacks through usage patterns and timing
- Key management threats with device loss, compromise, or family access
- Sync conflict resolution without server access to plaintext data
- Healthcare sharing without exposing data to intermediary services

**Privacy-First Threat Assessment** [Source: architecture/data-models.md]

Reproductive health data requires specialized threat modeling:

- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Stealth mode requirements, family/partner surveillance
- **Legal Vulnerabilities**: Jurisdiction-specific reproductive rights legislation
- **Insurance/Employment**: Discrimination risks from health data exposure
- **Cross-Correlation**: Inference attacks from external healthcare data sources
- **Long-term Privacy**: Data retention across life events and legal changes

**Attack Surface Analysis** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

Multi-platform architecture expands attack surface:

**Client Applications:**

- iOS/Android: Platform security model, app sandboxing, keystore access
- Web: Browser security model, local storage, WASM execution environment
- Cross-platform: React Native bridge security, shared crypto-core vulnerabilities

**Network Layer:**

- TLS/HTTPS: Certificate pinning, MITM attacks, DNS hijacking
- API Endpoints: Input validation, rate limiting, authentication bypass
- CDN/Edge: Cloudflare security, content integrity, geographic restrictions

**Server Infrastructure:**

- Supabase: RLS policy enforcement, database access controls, backup security
- Vercel: Function execution environment, environment variable exposure
- Third-party: Sentry privacy configuration, external service integration

**Device Security Considerations** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

Device-specific threat vectors:

- **iOS**: Keychain access, app backgrounding, screenshot prevention, family sharing
- **Android**: Keystore security, work profile isolation, accessibility service abuse
- **Web**: Local storage encryption, browser extension interference, incognito mode

**Regulatory Threat Matrix** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

Legal and regulatory threats across jurisdictions:

- **HIPAA**: Healthcare data handling, business associate agreements, breach notification
- **GDPR**: Consent management, data portability, right to deletion, cross-border transfers
- **State Laws**: Reproductive health data protection, parental consent, mandatory reporting
- **International**: Cross-border data transfer restrictions, local data residency requirements

**Cultural Threat Assessment** [Source: architecture/ux-architecture-user-experience-design.md]

Cultural privacy threats requiring stealth capabilities:

- **Domestic Surveillance**: Family member device access, shared device usage
- **Social Stigma**: App discovery, notification exposure, search history
- **Cultural Restrictions**: Religious/cultural reproductive health taboos
- **Legal Persecution**: Jurisdictions with reproductive health criminalization

**Verification Status:** File structure validated against existing project architecture and docs organization patterns.

**Risk Assessment Framework**

Threat prioritization using impact and likelihood matrix:

- **Impact Scale**: 1-5 (1=Low, 5=Critical reproductive health data exposure)
- **Likelihood Scale**: 1-5 (1=Unlikely, 5=Highly probable)
- **Risk Score**: Impact Ã— Likelihood (1-25 scale)
- **Priority Thresholds**:
  - Critical (20-25): Immediate mitigation required
  - High (15-19): Mitigation within sprint
  - Medium (10-14): Mitigation within epic
  - Low (5-9): Monitor and document
  - Minimal (1-4): Accept risk with documentation

### Project Structure Alignment

Threat modeling aligns with established security-first architecture:

- Zero-knowledge architecture ensures systematic privacy protection
- Multi-platform deployment requires comprehensive attack surface analysis
- Cultural adaptation needs threat-aware stealth mode implementation
- Regulatory compliance requires jurisdiction-specific threat assessment

- [ ] Zero data leakage in privacy testing scenarios
- [ ] Stealth mode effectiveness validated across all cultural threat scenarios
- [ ] Regulatory compliance verified for all applicable jurisdictions (GDPR, HIPAA, state laws)

**Test Implementation Requirements:**

- Attack simulation testing for top 10 identified threat vectors
- Privacy leak detection automation integrated with CI/CD
- Cultural stealth mode effectiveness testing with real-world scenarios
- Legal compliance verification testing with jurisdiction-specific requirements
