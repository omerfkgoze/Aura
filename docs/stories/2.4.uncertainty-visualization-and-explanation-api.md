# Story 2.4: Uncertainty Visualization and Explanation API

## Parent Epic

**Epic 2: Core Cycle Tracking & Predictions** - This story builds on the probabilistic prediction engine (Story 2.3) by implementing clear visualization of prediction uncertainty with explanations of contributing factors, enabling users to understand why predictions have specific confidence levels and what affects accuracy.

## Status

**Approved**

## Story

**As a** user interpreting cycle predictions,
**I want** clear visualization of prediction uncertainty with explanations of contributing factors,
**so that** I understand why predictions have specific confidence levels and what affects accuracy.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Uncertainty band visualization showing probability ranges for cycle events
2. "Why this signal" explanations identifying factors influencing prediction confidence
3. Historical accuracy display showing how past predictions compared to actual events
4. Confidence factor breakdown (cycle regularity, data completeness, recent changes)
5. Interactive uncertainty exploration allowing users to see prediction sensitivity
6. Calibration metrics display helping users understand their personal prediction accuracy
7. On-device explanation generation without exposing data to external services
