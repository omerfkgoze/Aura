# Story 0.1: Monorepo Project Scaffolding and Tooling Setup

## Status

**Done**

## Story

**As a** developer starting a greenfield project,  
**I want** a fully configured monorepo with Nx workspace, TypeScript configuration, and build tooling,  
**so that** I can immediately begin feature development with consistent tooling across all packages.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Nx Monorepo Initialization**
   - Create new Nx workspace with TypeScript preset: `npx create-nx-workspace@latest aura --preset=ts --packageManager=pnpm`
   - Configure workspace structure: `apps/` (web, mobile, api), `libs/` (shared, crypto-core, ui)
   - Set up pnpm workspaces configuration in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
   - Configure Nx project.json files for each application and library

2. **TypeScript Configuration**
   - Root `tsconfig.base.json` with strict mode and path mapping configured
   - Per-project `tsconfig.json` extending base configuration
   - Shared types library (`libs/types`) with common interfaces
   - Configure TypeScript project references for optimal build performance

3. **Development Tooling Setup**
   - ESLint configuration with privacy-focused rules (no console.log in production)
   - Prettier with consistent formatting rules across all packages
   - Husky pre-commit hooks for linting and type checking
   - VS Code workspace settings with recommended extensions list

4. **Build System Configuration**
   - Nx build targets configured for each app (web: Vite, mobile: Metro, api: tsc)
   - Development server configurations with hot reload
   - Production build optimization settings
   - Build caching configuration for improved performance

5. **Package Management**
   - Root `package.json` with workspace scripts: `dev`, `build`, `test`, `lint`
   - Dependency management strategy (exact versions for crypto, loose for dev tools)
   - Security audit configuration: `pnpm audit --audit-level=moderate`

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

This story implements the foundational infrastructure described in the [Source Tree](architecture/source-tree.md) and follows the [Tech Stack](architecture/tech-stack.md) decisions.

### Key Technical Details

**Monorepo Structure** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

- **apps/web**: Next.js web application with SSR disabled for PII protection
- **apps/mobile**: Expo/React Native cross-platform mobile app
- **apps/api**: Standalone API service (optional, mostly using Next.js API routes)
- **libs/crypto-core**: Rust/WASM crypto implementation (will be set up in later story)
- **libs/shared-types**: TypeScript type definitions shared across apps
- **libs/ui**: Shared UI components using Tamagui for cross-platform design
- **libs/utils**: Shared utility functions

**Build Tools** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- **Nx 17.x**: Monorepo orchestration with build caching and dependency management
- **Vite**: Fast bundler for web app
- **Metro**: React Native bundler for mobile
- **pnpm**: Package manager for better dependency management

**TypeScript Configuration** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

- **Type Sharing Rule**: All types defined in `libs/shared-types` and imported from there
- Strict mode enabled for type safety across entire stack
- Path mapping configured to use `@aura/shared-types`, `@aura/ui` etc.

**Development Workflow** [Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]

```bash
# After setup, these commands should work:
pnpm install              # Install all dependencies
pnpm nx run-many --target=dev --all  # Start all services
pnpm nx run-many --target=build --all # Build all packages
pnpm nx run-many --target=test --all  # Run all tests
pnpm nx run-many --target=lint --all  # Lint all packages
```

**Security Considerations** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

- ESLint rules must prevent console.log in production builds (privacy requirement)
- Dependency versions for crypto libraries must be exact (security requirement)
- Security audit must be configured to run on moderate level

**Project Structure Alignment**

- Source tree structure matches exactly with architecture specification
- File paths align with coding standards naming conventions
- Build system supports the full stack: TypeScript + Next.js + React Native + Rust/WASM

### Testing

**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- **Frontend Testing**: Vitest + Testing Library for fast unit/integration tests
- **Backend Testing**: Vitest + Supertest for API testing
- Test files location: Each package should have its own `src/__tests__/` directory
- Testing frameworks: Use Vitest for consistent tooling across all packages
- No E2E tests required for this scaffolding story

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-28

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent scaffolding implementation with comprehensive tooling setup. All architectural decisions align with coding standards and security requirements. The monorepo structure provides solid foundation for secure development.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: .npmrc
  - **Change**: Updated pnpm configuration for better performance and security
  - **Why**: Removed deprecated config options and added auto-install-peers for dependency management
  - **How**: Replaced package-manager-strict with package-manager=pnpm, added node-linker optimization

- **File**: .husky/pre-commit
  - **Change**: Added missing Husky pre-commit hook configuration
  - **Why**: AC requirement for pre-commit hooks was not fully implemented
  - **How**: Created proper Husky directory structure with lint-staged integration

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: âœ“ TypeScript strict mode, proper path mapping, security rules configured
- Project Structure: âœ“ Follows source-tree.md specification exactly
