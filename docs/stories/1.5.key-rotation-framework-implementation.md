# Story 1.5: Key Rotation Framework Implementation

## Parent Epic

**Epic 1: Foundation & Privacy Infrastructure** - Key rotation framework implementation delivers automated key rotation capabilities with seamless data migration, building upon the device-specific key management infrastructure (Story 1.4) to provide long-term security maintenance without user disruption.

## Status

**Draft**

## Story

**As a** long-term security maintainer,
**I want** automated key rotation capabilities with seamless data migration,
**so that** cryptographic keys can be updated without data loss or user disruption.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Key rotation scheduling system with configurable rotation intervals**
   - Configurable rotation policies based on time intervals, usage counts, or security events
   - Automated background scheduling with user-controlled timing preferences
   - Policy-based rotation management with different schedules for different key purposes
   - System events triggering emergency rotations when security incidents detected

2. **Backward-compatible decryption supporting multiple key versions simultaneously**
   - Multiple key version support allowing decryption of data encrypted with older keys
   - Graceful key version transitions without breaking existing encrypted data
   - Key version validation and integrity checking across all operations
   - Legacy key retention policies with secure cleanup after migration completion

3. **Progressive data re-encryption with user-controlled migration timing**
   - Batch processing system for re-encrypting large datasets without performance impact
   - User-controlled migration scheduling allowing rotation during low-usage periods
   - Progress tracking and resumable migration process handling interruptions
   - Data integrity validation throughout the migration process

4. **Key rotation audit trail maintaining rotation history for compliance**
   - Comprehensive audit logging of all key rotation events and operations
   - Rotation history tracking with timestamps, reasons, and success/failure status
   - Compliance reporting capabilities for security audit requirements
   - Tamper-evident audit trail with cryptographic integrity verification

5. **Emergency key rotation capability for security incident response**
   - Immediate key rotation triggering for compromised device or security breach scenarios
   - Emergency rotation procedures bypassing normal scheduling constraints
   - Security incident response integration with rapid key invalidation
   - Emergency recovery procedures ensuring data accessibility during incident response

6. **Cross-device key rotation synchronization without exposing keys**
   - Secure key rotation synchronization across all registered devices
   - Zero-knowledge key rotation where no device exposes keys during rotation
   - Device-specific rotation completion tracking and validation
   - Offline device handling with delayed rotation synchronization upon reconnection

7. **Key rotation testing framework validating migration correctness**
   - Comprehensive testing suite validating rotation operations across all scenarios
   - Data integrity verification ensuring no data loss during rotation processes
   - Performance testing ensuring rotation operations meet user experience requirements
   - Security validation confirming rotation maintains cryptographic strength
