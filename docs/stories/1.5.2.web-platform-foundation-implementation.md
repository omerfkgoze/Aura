# Story 1.5.2: Web Platform Foundation Implementation

## Parent Epic

**Epic 1.5: Development Environment Foundation - Brownfield Enhancement** - This story focuses on transforming the placeholder web page into a real Aura dashboard with Tamagui design system integration, responsive design foundation, and basic navigation structure following UX Architecture patterns.

## Status

**Draft**

## Story

**As a** developer on the Aura project,
**I want** the web platform to display real Aura branding and functional UI instead of placeholder content,
**so that** the web app provides an authentic foundation for menstrual tracking with proper design system integration.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Placeholder page removal and real UI implementation with Aura branding
2. Tamagui theming and design system integration across web platform
3. Basic navigation structure following UX Architecture patterns
4. Responsive design foundation supporting mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints
5. Cultural preset foundation implemented for stealth mode preparation
6. Zero TypeScript errors and build warnings after implementation

  - [ ] Create adaptive layout components using Tamagui responsive utilities
  - [ ] Test responsive behavior across all target device sizes
  - [ ] Ensure accessibility standards maintained at all breakpoints
  - [ ] Verify proper scaling and touch targets on mobile devices

- [ ] **Task 5: Cultural Preset Foundation** (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Implement basic cultural preset system for stealth mode preparation
  - [ ] Create placeholder stealth mode toggle component
  - [ ] Add foundation for cultural theme adaptation (color, typography)
  - [ ] Implement basic privacy mode state management
  - [ ] Test cultural preset switching functionality

- [ ] **Task 6: Build Verification and Testing** (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Run `pnpm build` and ensure web application builds successfully
  - [ ] Execute `pnpm type-check` and resolve any TypeScript errors
  - [ ] Verify `pnpm dev` starts web development server without issues
  - [ ] Test all implemented features work correctly in development mode
  - [ ] Confirm responsive design works across browser developer tools

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- **Story 1.5.1**: Development environment stabilized with zero TypeScript errors, dependency conflicts resolved, Tamagui 1.132.24+ confirmed working, development servers reliable [Source: docs/stories/1.5.1.development-environment-stabilization.md]
- **Epic Context**: Next.js 15.x web app currently shows placeholder content in page.tsx, Tamagui design system dependencies already installed and ready for integration [Source: docs/prd/epic-1.5-development-environment-foundation.md]

### Data Models

- No specific data models required for this UI foundation story
- Cultural preset types and privacy mode state will be basic placeholders
- Future stories will integrate with EncryptedUserPrefs and stealth mode data structures [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]

### API Specifications

- No backend API integration required for this foundation story
- UI components will render static/placeholder content
- Future integration points prepared for REST API endpoints [Source: docs/architecture/api-specification.md]

### Component Specifications

- **Tamagui Integration**: Use Tamagui 1.132.24+ cross-platform design system components [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Adaptive Launch Interface**: Implement foundation for context-aware interface display [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#adaptive-launch-interface]
- **Color Palette**: Primary #2E5266, Secondary #4A7C7E, Accent #E8B04B following UX Architecture [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#color-palette]
- **Typography**: Inter primary font for web-safe, excellent readability [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#typography]

### File Locations

- **Web App Entry**: `apps/web/app/page.tsx` main application entry point [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Components**: `apps/web/src/components/` for web-specific components [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Shared UI**: `libs/ui/` for cross-platform Tamagui components [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Layout**: Follow Next.js 15.x app directory structure [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Testing Requirements

- **Build Testing**: Web application must build successfully with nx build command [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
