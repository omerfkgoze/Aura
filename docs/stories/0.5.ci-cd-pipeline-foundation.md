## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

This story implements the CI/CD pipeline foundation specified in [Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md] and establishes the automated quality gates required for secure development workflow defined in [Source: architecture/development-workflow.md].

### Previous Story Insights

From Stories 0.1-0.4 completion:

- **Monorepo Structure**: Nx workspace established with proper build caching and dependency management
- **TypeScript Configuration**: Strict compilation settings require careful CI/CD validation
- **Security Foundation**: Rust/WASM crypto core requires specialized security validation in CI
- **External Services**: Supabase, Vercel, and Sentry integrations ready for CI/CD automation
- **Build Complexity**: Multi-target builds (web, mobile, WASM) require sophisticated pipeline orchestration

Key Lessons:

- Nx build dependency ordering critical for CI/CD pipeline success
- WASM compilation in CI requires specific Rust toolchain configuration
- Security audit automation must cover both npm and Cargo dependency trees
- Database migrations need automated testing against staging environment

### Key Technical Details

**CI/CD Pipeline Requirements** [Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md]

The deployment architecture specifies a comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow structure:

```yaml
# Required workflow structure
workflows:
  - security-audit.yml # Automated security validation
  - build-test.yml # Build and test pipeline
  - deploy.yml # Deployment pipeline
```

**Security Audit Pipeline** [Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md]

Essential security validation steps for every build:

- `pnpm audit` for npm dependency vulnerability scanning
- `pnpm nx run-many --target=security-check --all` for package-level security validation
- `pnpm nx run crypto-core:security-audit` for Rust/WASM specific security checks
- GitHub Security Advisories integration for automated vulnerability detection

**Build and Test Pipeline Requirements**

Based on established monorepo structure, CI must validate:

- TypeScript compilation across all packages: `pnpm nx run-many --target=build --all`
- Linting and formatting: ESLint and Prettier validation with fail-fast
- Test execution: `pnpm nx run-many --target=test --all` with coverage reporting
- E2E testing: `pnpm nx run-many --target=e2e --all` for integration validation

**Deployment Pipeline Configuration** [Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md]

Environment-specific deployment requirements:

| Environment | Trigger    | Approval  | Database        | Monitoring        |
| ----------- | ---------- | --------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| Staging     | PR open    | Automatic | Migration test  | Sentry staging    |
| Production  | Main merge | Manual    | Migration apply | Sentry production |

**File Locations** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

CI/CD configuration should follow established structure:

```
.github/
└── workflows/
    ├── security-audit.yml  # Security validation pipeline
    ├── build-test.yml      # Build and test validation
    └── deploy.yml          # Deployment automation
```

**Development Workflow Integration** [Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]

CI/CD must support established development commands:

- Local development: `pnpm nx run-many --target=dev --all`
- Testing: `pnpm nx run-many --target=test --all`
- Security validation: `pnpm nx run-many --target=security-check --all`
- Production build: `pnpm nx build crypto-core && pnpm nx build web && pnpm nx build mobile`

**Environment Configuration Requirements**

Based on development workflow, CI/CD must handle:

- Supabase CLI integration for database migrations
- Vercel deployment integration with proper environment variables
- EAS (Expo Application Services) for mobile app deployment
- Sentry integration for error monitoring and release tracking

**Security Integration Requirements** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

Security-first development standards require CI/CD enforcement of:

- Zero-knowledge principle validation (no plaintext data in logs)
- Crypto operation verification (AAD validation, memory safety)
- RLS policy testing in database migrations
- Input sanitization validation across all user inputs

**Coverage and Quality Thresholds**

Based on criticality levels:

- `crypto-core`: Minimum 80% test coverage (critical security component)
- Other packages: Minimum 60% test coverage (standard development components)
- ESLint: Zero violations allowed (code quality gate)
- TypeScript: Strict compilation required (type safety gate)

### Project Structure Alignment

CI/CD pipeline aligns with established monorepo patterns:

- Nx workspace configuration supports build orchestration and caching
- Package dependency graph ensures proper build ordering
- Multi-target deployment (web, mobile, API) supported through pipeline stages
- Security validation integrated at every stage of the pipeline

### Testing

**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]

CI/CD testing must include:

- **Unit Testing**: Comprehensive coverage for all packages using established test frameworks
- **Integration Testing**: WASM bindings, API endpoints, database operations
- **Security Testing**: Crypto operations, dependency vulnerability scanning, secret detection
- **E2E Testing**: Cross-platform functionality validation
- **Performance Testing**: Build time optimization, deployment verification

**Test File Execution**:

- Vitest for unit and integration tests across all packages
- Playwright for E2E testing (cross-platform support)
- Custom security validation scripts for crypto-core
- Database migration testing using Supabase local environment

**Quality Gate Requirements**:

- All tests must pass before merge to main branch
- Coverage thresholds enforced automatically
- Security vulnerabilities block deployment
- Performance regression detection and alerting
