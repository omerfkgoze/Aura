## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

This story implements comprehensive security gate framework as foundational infrastructure specified in [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md] to enforce zero-knowledge architecture principles and privacy-first development patterns across all Epic implementations.

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 0.9 completion (Web Security Headers and CSP Implementation):

- **Security Header Framework**: Established comprehensive web security headers providing foundation for security validation
- **CSP Violation Monitoring**: Privacy-safe security violation reporting with Sentry integration established
- **Certificate Pinning Implementation**: Certificate validation and monitoring patterns established for network security
- **Browser Security Testing**: Cross-browser security testing framework provides pattern for comprehensive security gates

Key Integration Points:

- Security gates must integrate with existing CSP violation monitoring without PII exposure
- Network analysis must build on certificate pinning implementation for comprehensive validation
- Client-side security validation must extend existing Trusted Types and DOM security framework
- Testing framework must integrate with established Vitest and Playwright infrastructure

### Security Gate Requirements [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Zero-Knowledge Principle Enforcement:**

- **Server PII Prevention**: Automated detection of any plaintext health data on server-side
- **Crypto Operation Validation**: All encryption/decryption must use standardized crypto-core operations
- **AAD Validation**: Additional Authenticated Data must be present in all crypto operations
- **Memory Safety**: Crypto operations must zeroize sensitive data after use

**Critical Security Controls:**

- **RLS Enforcement**: Database queries must use `auth.uid()` for user isolation
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs validated with Zod schemas before processing
- **Token Expiration**: All tokens must have explicit expiration and validation
- **Audit Trail**: All healthcare sharing activities must be logged (privacy-safe)

### Technology Stack Integration [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Testing Framework Requirements:**

**Primary Testing:** Vitest + Testing Library for unit/integration tests
**E2E Testing:** Playwright for cross-platform end-to-end testing

### Data Models Integration [Source: architecture/data-models.md]

**CryptoEnvelope Validation Requirements:**

Required CryptoEnvelope structure for validation:

```typescript
interface CryptoEnvelope {
  version: number; // Schema version
  algorithm: string; // e.g., "XChaCha20Poly1305"
  kdfParams: {
    algorithm: string; // e.g., "Argon2id"
    memory: number; // KB - minimum 64MB
    iterations: number; // minimum 3
    parallelism: number; // minimum 1
  };
  salt: string; // Base64 encoded - minimum 32 bytes
  nonce: string; // Base64 encoded - algorithm-specific length
  keyId: string; // Key rotation identifier

  // Additional Authenticated Data for integrity
  aad: {
    userId: string;
    recordId: string;
    tableName: string;
    version: number;
    timestamp: string; // ISO string
  };
}
```

**RLS Policy Testing Requirements:**

All database tables must have RLS enabled with policies testing:

- `EncryptedUserPrefs`: RLS policy `auth.uid() = userId`
- `EncryptedCycleData`: RLS policy `auth.uid() = userId`
- `HealthcareShare`: RLS policy `auth.uid() = userId`
- `DeviceKey`: RLS policy `auth.uid() = userId`

### Frontend Architecture Integration [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

**Client-Side Security Validation Requirements:**

**SSR-PII Prevention:**

- No plaintext health data in server-side rendering
- All sensitive data must be client-side decrypted only
- HTML source must contain only encrypted payloads

**Client Storage Security:**

- IndexedDB encryption validation for all sensitive data
- localStorage must never contain plaintext health information
- Client-side crypto must use established crypto-core WASM operations

**Stealth Mode Compatibility:**

- Security gates must not interfere with stealth mode functionality
- Privacy-adaptive components must pass security validation
- Cultural adaptation must maintain security standards

### Backend Architecture Integration [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]

**API Security Gate Requirements:**

**RPC Function Validation:**

- Service accounts must have minimal privilege access patterns
- Optimistic concurrency must be validated in all data mutations

**Authentication Integration:**

- WebAuthn registration and verification security testing

### Critical Implementation Requirements

**Security Gate Design Principles:**

1. **Fail-Safe Default**: All security gates must fail closed, blocking deployment on any security violation
2. **Zero False Positives**: Security gates must be precisely tuned to prevent blocking valid operations
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Every security requirement must have corresponding automated validation
4. **Performance Optimized**: Security gates must not significantly impact CI/CD pipeline performance
5. **Privacy Preserving**: Security gate reporting must not expose PII or sensitive data

**Integration Requirements:**

- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions workflow integration with deployment blocking on gate failures
- **Monitoring Integration**: Sentry integration for security gate violation reporting (privacy-safe)
- **Development Integration**: Local development environment security gate validation
- **Testing Integration**: Comprehensive test coverage for all security gate components

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**

- **PASS:** All crypto envelopes valid, zero PII in network/logs, RLS prevents unauthorized access, client security enforced
- **FAIL:** Any malformed crypto envelope, PII exposure detected, RLS bypass possible, client security vulnerability present

**Test Implementation Framework:**
