## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

This story implements the foundational cryptographic infrastructure as specified in the tech stack, establishing secure Rust/WASM crypto core with memory hygiene and TypeScript integration before authentication and key management implementation.

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.1 completion (Database Infrastructure and Security Setup):

- **Database Schema Foundation**: Crypto envelope structure must support the CryptoEnvelope JSONB format established in the database schema
- **Security Gate Integration**: Crypto core must pass security gate validation for proper encryption envelope generation

- **Zero-Knowledge Validation**: Crypto core must ensure server never accesses plaintext data

Key Integration Points:

  encryptCycleData(
    data: CycleData,
    userKey: UserKey,
    deviceIdHash: string
  ): Promise<EncryptedPayload>;

  decryptCycleData(
    encryptedPayload: string,
