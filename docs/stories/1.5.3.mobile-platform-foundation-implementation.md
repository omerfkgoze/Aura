# Story 1.5.3: Mobile Platform Foundation Implementation

## Parent Epic

**Epic 1.5: Development Environment Foundation - Brownfield Enhancement** - This story focuses on transforming the placeholder App.tsx into a real navigation structure with screens architecture, implementing stealth mode foundation for cultural adaptation, and establishing cross-platform component integration following UX Architecture patterns.

## Status

**Approved**

## Story

**As a** developer on the Aura project,
**I want** the mobile app to display authentic navigation structure and cultural adaptation foundation instead of placeholder content,
**so that** the mobile platform provides a complete foundation for menstrual tracking with stealth mode preparation and cross-platform consistency.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Navigation architecture implementation with screen structure creation following UX Architecture
2. Stealth mode foundation (cultural presets preparation) integrated into mobile app
3. Cross-platform component integration using shared Tamagui components
4. App.tsx placeholder removal and authentic mobile interface implementation
5. Cultural context detection and adaptive interface foundation
6. Zero TypeScript errors and build warnings after mobile implementation
