## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

This story implements SLSA Level 2 compliance and supply-chain security hardening as specified in [Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md] and builds upon the CI/CD pipeline foundation established in Story 0.5 to provide comprehensive build security and provenance.

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 0.5 (CI/CD Pipeline Foundation) completion:

- **GitHub Actions Infrastructure**: Comprehensive workflow structure established with security-audit, build-test, and deploy pipelines
- **Security Integration**: Multi-layered security validation including npm audit, Cargo audit, and WASM security checks
- **Dependency Management**: PNPM workspace with proper lockfile management and build optimization
- **Artifact Management**: Proper build artifact retention and security report generation established
- **Monitoring Integration**: Sentry integration and deployment notification systems configured

Key Lessons:

- Build isolation is critical for reproducible SLSA compliance
- WASM artifacts require special consideration for SBOM generation and signing
- Multi-package monorepo requires coordinated SBOM aggregation across npm and Cargo ecosystems
- Supply-chain security must integrate seamlessly with existing GitHub Actions workflows

### Key Technical Details

**SLSA Level 2 Requirements** [Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md]

SLSA Level 2 compliance requires the following build security measures:

- **Build Provenance**: Cryptographically signed attestation of build process
- **Isolated Builds**: No network access during build, hermetic build environment
- **Reproducible Builds**: Deterministic output given same source and build environment
- **Build Service**: Third-party build service (GitHub Actions) with proper isolation

**GitHub Actions SLSA Integration**

Based on established CI/CD pipeline, SLSA implementation requires:

```yaml
# Required SLSA workflow integration
jobs:
  build:
    permissions:
      id-token: write # For Sigstore signing
      contents: read
      attestations: write # For build provenance
    uses: slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/.github/workflows/generator_generic_slsa3.yml@v1.9.0
```

**SBOM Generation Requirements**

Multi-ecosystem SBOM generation for monorepo structure:

- **npm Dependencies**: Use `@cyclonedx/bom` for TypeScript/JavaScript packages
- **Cargo Dependencies**: Use `cargo-cyclonedx` for Rust/WASM crypto-core
- **SBOM Aggregation**: Combine multiple SBOMs into unified project-level SBOM
- **Format Compatibility**: Support both SPDX and CycloneDX formats for tooling integration

**Package Security Strategy** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

Based on established technology stack:

- **Crypto Dependencies**: Exact version pinning required for `libsodium-sys`, `getrandom`, `wasm-bindgen`
- **Development Dependencies**: Automated updates allowed with approval workflow
- **Supply-chain Protection**: Scoped package usage, dependency confusion protection
- **Vulnerability Thresholds**: Critical/High vulnerabilities block deployment

**Build Security Hardening Requirements** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

Security-first development standards require:

- **Secret Prevention**: No secrets in build artifacts or logs
- **Environment Isolation**: Sandboxed build with minimal network access
- **Integrity Verification**: Cryptographic checksums for all artifacts
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of build and deployment activities

**File Locations** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

SLSA and supply-chain security files should follow established structure:

```
.github/
└── workflows/
    ├── slsa-build.yml          # ✅ SLSA Level 2 build workflow
    ├── sbom-generation.yml     # ✅ SBOM generation and signing
    └── deploy.yml              # ✅ Updated with SLSA verification

tools/
└── security/
    ├── slsa-verify.js          # ✅ SLSA provenance verification
    ├── slsa-verify.test.js     # ✅ SLSA verification tests
    ├── sbom-aggregate.js       # ✅ Multi-ecosystem SBOM aggregation
    └── sbom-aggregate.test.js  # ✅ SBOM aggregation tests
```

**Integration with Existing Workflows**

SLSA and SBOM generation must integrate with established CI/CD pipeline:

- **Security Audit**: Enhanced with supply-chain attack detection
- **Build Test**: Extended with SLSA provenance generation
- **Deploy**: Enhanced with artifact verification and SBOM publishing

**Reproducible Build Configuration**

For SLSA Level 2 compliance, builds must be reproducible:

- **Deterministic Timestamps**: Use `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` for build timestamps
- **Environment Isolation**: Container-based builds with pinned base images
- **Dependency Locking**: Strict lockfile enforcement with integrity verification
- **Tool Versioning**: Exact versions for build tools (Node.js, Rust, wasm-pack)

**Sigstore Integration Requirements**

Build artifact signing with Sigstore:

- **Keyless Signing**: Use GitHub OIDC token for cosign signing
- **Transparency Log**: Automatic entry in Sigstore transparency log (Rekor)
- **Verification**: Automated verification in deployment pipeline
- **Certificate Authority**: Use Fulcio for ephemeral certificate generation

### Project Structure Alignment

SLSA compliance aligns with established monorepo patterns:

- **Nx Workspace**: Build orchestration supports isolated, reproducible builds
- **Multi-Target Builds**: SLSA provenance covers web, mobile, and WASM artifacts
- **Security Integration**: SLSA workflows extend existing security validation pipeline
- **Package Management**: PNPM workspaces support exact dependency pinning strategies

## Testing

**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]

SLSA and supply-chain security testing must include:

- **Provenance Verification**: Automated testing of SLSA build attestations
- **SBOM Validation**: Comprehensive testing of SBOM completeness and accuracy
- **Reproducible Builds**: Verification that builds produce identical output
- **Supply-chain Scanning**: Automated detection of malicious or suspicious dependencies
- **Artifact Integrity**: Verification of cryptographic signatures and checksums

**Test File Execution**:

- Vitest for SLSA verification and SBOM validation utilities
- Custom scripts for reproducible build verification
- Integration tests for supply-chain security scanning
- End-to-end tests for complete SLSA attestation workflow

**Quality Gate Requirements**:

- SLSA provenance must be generated and verifiable for all production builds
- SBOM must include all transitive dependencies with vulnerability mapping
- Build reproducibility must be verified with deterministic output
- Supply-chain scanning must detect and prevent malicious dependencies
