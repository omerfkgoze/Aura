## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

This story implements comprehensive web security headers and Content Security Policy as specified in [Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md] and [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md] to establish client-side attack prevention as foundational privacy infrastructure for the zero-knowledge architecture.

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 0.8 completion (Database Security Hardening):

- **RLS Policy Framework**: Established server-side data access controls requiring client-side security integration
- **Certificate Pinning Foundation**: Database certificate pinning provides pattern for API certificate pinning
- **Security Monitoring Integration**: Sentry privacy-safe configuration established for security violation monitoring
- **Audit Trail Requirements**: Privacy-safe logging patterns established for CSP violation reporting

Key Integration Points:

- Certificate pinning implementation must integrate with existing database certificate pinning
- CSP reporting must use existing Sentry privacy-safe configuration without PII exposure
- Security headers must support stealth mode functionality without compromising protection
- HTTP security configuration must maintain compatibility with zero-knowledge architecture

### Web Security Requirements [Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md]

**Frontend Security Configuration:**

Required CSP Headers:

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'wasm-unsafe-eval' 'nonce-{{NONCE}}'; connect-src 'self' https://*.supabase.co; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: https:; font-src 'self'; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'self'; form-action 'self';
```

**Rate Limiting Integration:**

- Rate Limiting: 100 requests/minute per IP, 1000/hour per authenticated user
- CSP violation reporting must respect rate limits to prevent DoS attacks

**CORS Policy Configuration:**

- CORS Policy: Restricted to production domains only
- Must integrate with CSP for comprehensive cross-origin protection

### Next.js and Vite Integration [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Build Tool Configuration:**

Next.js 14.x with Vite bundler requires specific security header integration:

**Next.js API Routes Security:**

- CSP nonce generation for server-side rendering
- Security header middleware for all API routes
- Integration with existing authentication middleware

**Vite Build Pipeline Integration:**

- SRI hash generation during Vite build process
- Automated hash validation in production builds
- Integration with existing build caching and optimization

### Frontend Architecture Integration [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

**Component Security Requirements:**

Stealth Mode CSP Compatibility:

- CSP policies must not interfere with stealth transition animations
- Dynamic content loading for disguise modes must maintain security
- Cultural adaptation components must work within strict CSP constraints

**Privacy-Adaptive Security:**

- CSP violation reporting must not expose stealth mode status
- Security headers must maintain effectiveness across all cultural presets
- Certificate pinning must support cultural app disguises authentically

### Security Header Configuration [Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md]

**Deployment Platform Requirements:**

**Vercel Configuration:**

- Security headers configured via `vercel.json` and Next.js middleware
- Edge network integration for global security header deployment
- Certificate pinning configuration for production domains

**Environment-Specific Configuration:**

- Development: Relaxed CSP for local development and hot reload
- Staging: Production-equivalent security with additional debugging headers
- Production: Strict security with comprehensive monitoring and alerting
