```bash
# Install required tools
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh  # Rust
npm install -g pnpm  # Package manager
npm install -g @supabase/cli  # Supabase CLI
npm install -g nx  # Nx CLI

# Setup Supabase locally
supabase start
supabase db reset  # Apply all migrations and policies

# Build crypto core
pnpm nx build crypto-core

# Generate types from database
pnpm nx run shared-types:generate-db-types
```

**Development Commands** [Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]

Standard development workflow commands:

```bash
# Start all services (mobile simulator + web dev server)
pnpm nx run-many --target=dev --all

# Start mobile only
pnpm nx dev mobile

# Start web only
pnpm nx dev web

# Run tests (unit + integration)
pnpm nx run-many --target=test --all

# Security validation
pnpm nx run-many --target=security-check --all
```

**File Locations** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

Environment and configuration files should be placed at:

- `.env.example` - Root level template
- `apps/web/.env.local` - Web app specific variables
- `apps/mobile/.env.local` - Mobile app specific variables
- `libs/utils/src/env-validation.ts` - Environment validation schemas
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` - Development setup documentation
- `docs/adrs/` - Architecture Decision Records directory

**Security Requirements** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

Critical security standards for development environment:

- **Zero-Knowledge Principle:** Server must never access plaintext health data
- **Input Sanitization:** All user inputs validated with Zod schemas before processing
- **Memory Safety:** Crypto operations must zeroize sensitive data after use
- **Device Privacy:** Device fingerprinting must use salted hashes with user-specific salts
- **Emergency Controls:** All UI must support immediate stealth mode activation

**Tech Stack Alignment** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

Development tools and frameworks:

- **Monitoring:** Sentry (privacy-safe) - Error tracking without PII
- **Logging:** Technical metrics only - Privacy-first: no user data
- **State Management:** Zustand + TanStack Query - UI state + server sync separation
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Supabase) - Managed DB with RLS
- **Cache:** Redis (Supabase) - Session and metadata caching

### Project Structure Alignment

File paths and structure align with established source tree:

- Environment files follow monorepo structure with app-specific configurations
- Documentation placed in `docs/` directory as per source tree specification
- Utility functions in `libs/utils/` following shared package pattern
- ADR structure follows standard architecture documentation practices

### Testing

**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- **Frontend Testing:** Vitest + Testing Library for fast unit/integration tests
- **Backend Testing:** Vitest + Supertest for API testing
- **Test File Location:** Each package should have its own `src/__tests__/` directory
- **Testing Framework:** Use Vitest for consistent tooling across all packages
- **Environment Testing:** Validate environment variable loading and validation schemas
- **Security Testing:** Test CORS policies, CSP headers, and secure cookie configurations

### Recommended Status

❌ **Changes Required** - Must implement test coverage before moving to Done

**Blocking Issues:**

1. Zero test coverage for critical security and environment functionality
2. No validation that security configurations work as intended
3. Missing test framework setup contradicts completed task claims

**Next Actions:**

1. Developer must implement comprehensive test suite
2. Add at least P0 tests for each acceptance criteria
3. Validate all security configurations with automated tests
4. Update File List with new test files
