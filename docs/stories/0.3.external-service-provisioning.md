## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

This story establishes the external service infrastructure required for the complete deployment pipeline described in [Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md] and implements the service integration patterns defined in [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md].

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 0.1 and 0.2 completion:

- Nx monorepo structure established with comprehensive build pipeline
- Development environment configured with local Supabase and Docker setup
- Environment variable validation implemented with Zod schemas
- Security headers and privacy-safe logging configured

### Key Technical Details

**Supabase Configuration** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]

Critical Supabase settings for zero-knowledge architecture:

- **Row Level Security (RLS):** Must be enabled by default on all tables
- **WebAuthn Configuration:** Enable passkey authentication for hardware-backed security
- **Service Role Restrictions:** Service role limited to schema management, never user data access
- **Connection Pooling:** Configure for high availability with security-first settings
- **Database Firewall:** Restrict connections to authorized IP ranges only

**Deployment Pipeline Integration** [Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md]

Required Vercel configuration for secure deployment:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "apps/web/package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/next"
    }
  ],
  "env": {
    "NODE_ENV": "production",
    "SUPABASE_URL": "@supabase-url-prod",
    "SUPABASE_ANON_KEY": "@supabase-anon-key-prod"
  },
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Strict-Transport-Security",
          "value": "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Privacy-Safe Monitoring** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

Sentry configuration must prevent any health data exposure:

- **Data Scrubbing:** Enable all PII scrubbing rules automatically
- **Error Context Filtering:** Remove any user-identifiable information from error reports
- **Performance Monitoring:** Track technical metrics only, never user behavior
- **Session Replay:** Completely disabled for privacy protection

**Mobile App Store Requirements** [Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md]

App store setup considerations for reproductive health app:

- **Privacy Policy:** Must explicitly address reproductive health data protection
- **Age Rating:** Appropriate rating for health and medical apps
- **Content Guidelines:** Compliance with health app guidelines for both platforms
- **Geographic Restrictions:** Consider regional availability based on legal requirements

**Environment Variables Structure** [Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]

Production environment variables required:

```bash
# Production Frontend
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://[project-id].supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[anon-key]
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://aura.app/api
EXPO_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=[web-dsn]

# Production Backend
SUPABASE_URL=https://[project-id].supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=[service-role-key]
DATABASE_URL=[supabase-db-url]
SENTRY_DSN=[api-dsn]
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=[production-secret]

# Shared Production
NODE_ENV=production
APP_VERSION=[release-version]
SECURITY_AUDIT_ENABLED=true
```

**File Locations** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

Service configuration files should be placed at:

- `infrastructure/supabase/config.toml` - Supabase CLI configuration
- `vercel.json` - Vercel deployment configuration
- `infrastructure/sentry/` - Sentry configuration files
- `docs/deployment-guide.md` - Service setup documentation
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - CI/CD pipeline with service integration

**Security Considerations** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

Critical security requirements for external services:

- **Zero-Knowledge Principle:** External services must never access plaintext health data
- **Token Management:** All service tokens must have appropriate scoping and expiration
- **Network Security:** All external communications must use certificate pinning
- **Audit Trail:** All service integrations must support audit logging
- **Emergency Controls:** Service configurations must support immediate access revocation

### Project Structure Alignment

External service configurations align with established monorepo structure:

- Infrastructure configurations in dedicated `infrastructure/` directory
- Deployment configurations at root level for platform recognition
- Documentation in `docs/` following established pattern
- CI/CD workflows in `.github/workflows/` with proper service integration

### Testing

**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- **Service Integration Testing:** Validate connectivity and authentication for all external services
- **Configuration Testing:** Verify environment variables and service configurations
- **Security Testing:** Validate privacy and security settings for each service
- **Deployment Testing:** Test complete deployment pipeline from development to production
- **Monitoring Testing:** Verify error reporting and monitoring without PII exposure

**Test File Locations:**

- `apps/web/src/__tests__/service-integration.test.ts` - Service connectivity tests
- `scripts/__tests__/deployment-validation.test.js` - Deployment configuration tests
- `infrastructure/__tests__/` - Infrastructure configuration validation tests

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-01

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Analysis Summary

Comprehensive review of external service provisioning story reveals significant progress in Vercel deployment setup with successful production deployment. However, several critical security configurations and documentation components remain incomplete, preventing full production readiness.

### Key Findings

**Completed Successfully:**

- ✅ Vercel deployment configuration with PNPM integration
- ✅ Production deployment successfully completed (https://aura-app.vercel.app)
- ✅ Service integration testing framework established
- ✅ Build pipeline issues resolved (Nx cache, PNPM conflicts)
- ✅ Basic environment variable structure in place

**Critical Gaps Identified:**

- ❌ Supabase security validation incomplete (RLS, WebAuthn verification)
- ❌ Sentry privacy-safe monitoring not implemented
- ❌ Mobile app store documentation missing
- ❌ Database migration workflow incomplete
- ❌ Security audit and compliance verification pending

### Risk Assessment

**High Priority Issues:**

- **SEC-001:** Missing Supabase security validation could allow insecure configurations in production
- **SEC-002:** Incomplete Sentry setup may lead to PII exposure in error logs

**Medium Priority Issues:**

- Missing documentation for custom domain setup and mobile app store preparation
- Incomplete database migration workflow setup

### Recommendations

1. **Complete security validation script** for Supabase configuration verification
2. **Implement privacy-safe Sentry configuration** with data scrubbing rules
3. **Finish mobile app store preparation** documentation and setup guides
4. **Complete database migration workflow** with Supabase CLI integration
5. **Document production deployment process** including SSL and custom domain setup
