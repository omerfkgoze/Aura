# Story 1.5.1: Development Environment Stabilization

## Parent Epic

**Epic 1.5: Development Environment Foundation - Brownfield Enhancement** - This story focuses on stabilizing the development environment by resolving dependency conflicts, eliminating TypeScript errors, optimizing build pipeline, and ensuring development server stability to enable efficient development workflow for subsequent UI implementation stories.

## Status

**Ready for Review**

## Story

**As a** developer on the Aura project,
**I want** a stable development environment with zero dependency conflicts and type errors,
**so that** I can efficiently develop and test web and mobile features without build pipeline issues.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Package.json dependency conflicts resolved across all workspace packages
2. TypeScript configuration alignment with strict mode maintained across web and mobile
3. Build pipeline optimization for consistent and fast builds
4. Development server stability with `pnpm dev` command running both platforms reliably
5. Zero TypeScript errors and build warnings in clean state
6. All existing functionality verified working after stabilization

  - [x] Execute `pnpm type-check` and resolve all TypeScript errors
  - [x] Verify `pnpm build` completes without warnings
  - [x] Test all scripts defined in root package.json work correctly
  - [x] Document any remaining known issues or workarounds needed

- [x] **Task 6: Functionality Regression Testing** (AC: 6)
  - [x] Verify existing UI components still render correctly
  - [x] Test crypto-core WASM integration still functions
  - [x] Validate database-security services work properly
  - [x] Confirm shared component libraries load without issues
  - [x] Test both web and mobile apps start and display placeholder content

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- **Story 2.5**: Offline-first synchronization skeleton completed with comprehensive testing suite. React Native and Next.js infrastructure proven stable with proper TypeScript configuration and Nx workspace setup [Source: docs/stories/2.5.offline-first-synchronization-skeleton.md]
- **Epic Context**: This is first story in Epic 1.5 focusing on brownfield enhancement. Existing Next.js web app and Expo React Native mobile app have basic structures with placeholder content, Nx monorepo configured with pnpm workspaces [Source: docs/prd/epic-1.5-development-environment-foundation.md]

### Data Models

- No specific data models required for this story - focus is on development environment stability
- Existing EncryptedCycleData and related types should remain functional after dependency updates [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#type-sharing]

### API Specifications

- No new API endpoints required - this story focuses on development infrastructure
- Existing service layer abstractions must continue working after environment stabilization [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#api-calls]

### Component Specifications

- **Tamagui Integration**: Ensure Tamagui 1.132.24+ cross-platform design system remains functional [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **React Native Components**: Expo/React Native 50.x components should continue working [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Next.js Components**: Next.js 15.x web components must render without TypeScript errors [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

### File Locations

- **Root Package Management**: `/package.json` contains workspace scripts and PNPM overrides [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Apps Directory**: `apps/mobile/` and `apps/web/` contain platform-specific applications [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Libs Directory**: `libs/` contains shared packages including crypto-core, shared-types, ui [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Build Configuration**: `nx.json`, `tsconfig.base.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml` for workspace coordination [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]

### Testing Requirements

- **Build Testing**: All workspace packages must build successfully with nx build command [Source: package.json scripts]
- **Type Checking**: TypeScript 5.3+ strict mode validation across all packages [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Lint Testing**: ESLint configuration must pass for all workspace packages [Source: package.json scripts]
- **Development Server Testing**: Both web and mobile development servers must start reliably [Source: Epic requirements]

### Technical Constraints

- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Must maintain TypeScript 5.3+ strict mode compliance [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Nx Monorepo**: All changes must work within Nx 21.x workspace structure [Source: package.json]
- **PNPM Workspaces**: Package management must use pnpm workspace configuration [Source: pnpm-workspace.yaml]
- **Zero Regression**: All existing functionality must continue working after stabilization [Epic AC: 6]

### Testing

#### Test File Locations

- **Workspace Testing**: Root level scripts test entire workspace coordination
- **Package Testing**: Each libs/ package contains its own test configuration
- **Integration Testing**: Development server startup and build process testing

#### Test Standards

- **Build Verification**: All packages must build without errors using Nx build system [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript strict mode validation required [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Lint Compliance**: ESLint rules must pass for all workspace packages [Source: package.json]

#### Testing Frameworks and Patterns

- **Nx Testing**: Use Nx workspace testing capabilities for monorepo validation
- **Development Server Testing**: Manual verification of `pnpm dev` command reliability
- **Build Pipeline Testing**: Automated verification of build process integrity

#### Specific Testing Requirements

- **Dependency Resolution**: Test that all packages install without conflicts
- **TypeScript Compilation**: Verify type checking passes across entire workspace
- **Build Process**: Ensure build completes successfully for all relevant packages
- **Development Server**: Test parallel startup of web and mobile development servers
- **Hot Reloading**: Verify development server features work correctly
- **Cross-Platform**: Test both web and mobile platforms function after changes
