### 3. Age Verification for Teen Content

Since reproductive health apps may be used by teenagers:

```javascript
// Age verification component
const AgeVerification = () => {
  const [birthDate, setBirthDate] = useState('');

  const verifyAge = () => {
    const age = calculateAge(birthDate);
    if (age < 13) {
      // Redirect to parental consent
      return redirectToParentalConsent();
    }
    if (age < 18) {
      // Show teen-specific privacy notice
      return showTeenPrivacyNotice();
    }
    // Continue with normal flow
    return proceedWithApp();
  };

  return <AgeVerificationScreen onVerify={verifyAge} privacyNotice={<HealthDataPrivacyNotice />} />;
};
```

## Regional Considerations

### 1. Legal Requirements by Region

```yaml
United States:
  - HIPAA compliance considerations
  - FDA guidance for health apps

European Union:
  - GDPR compliance mandatory
  - Medical device regulations (MDR)
  - Country-specific health data laws

Other Regions:
  - Research local reproductive health laws
  - Consider cultural sensitivities
  - Implement geo-blocking where required
```

### 2. Content Localization

```javascript
// Sensitive content handling
const getSensitiveContentForRegion = region => {
  const restrictions = {
    'conservative-regions': {
      showReproductiveHealth: false,
      useNeutralTerms: true,
      hideAdvancedFeatures: true,
    },
    'liberal-regions': {
      showReproductiveHealth: true,
      useNeutralTerms: false,
      hideAdvancedFeatures: false,
    },
  };

  return restrictions[getRegionCategory(region)];
};
```
