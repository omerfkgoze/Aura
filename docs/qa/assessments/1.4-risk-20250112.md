## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

**SEC-001 - Hardware Storage Vulnerabilities:**

- Platform-specific penetration testing on iOS Keychain, Android Keystore/StrongBox
- Hardware security module validation and fallback mechanism testing
- Key extraction attempt simulation across platforms
- Secure enclave detection accuracy validation
- Master key corruption recovery testing

**Required Test Environment:**

- Physical iOS devices with/without Secure Enclave
- Android devices with/without StrongBox support
- Various web browsers with WebCrypto API implementations

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

**SEC-002 - Multi-Device Protocol Security:**

- Man-in-the-middle attack simulation during device pairing
- Concurrent device registration race condition testing
- Device revocation and re-enrollment security validation
- Cross-device authentication bypass attempt testing

**SEC-003 - Key Derivation Hierarchy:**

- BIP32 implementation correctness validation
- Key isolation verification between data categories
- Forward secrecy property validation during rotation
- Cryptographic property-based testing with random inputs

**PERF-001 - Argon2id Performance:**

- Device capability detection accuracy testing
- Parameter auto-tuning validation across device classes
- Performance regression testing during KDF operations
- Memory usage validation under resource constraints

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

**TECH-001 - Integration Testing:**

- Rust/WASM binding validation across platforms
- Type safety validation with auto-generated TypeScript bindings

**OPS-001 - Key Rotation:**

- Versioned key management backward compatibility
- Progressive migration testing with simulated failures
- Automated rotation scheduling validation

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- **SEC-001**: Critical hardware storage vulnerabilities - Mandatory security audit sign-off
- **SEC-002**: High-severity multi-device protocol flaws affecting user data isolation
- **SEC-003**: Key derivation implementation correctness - Cryptographic review required

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- **PERF-001**: Performance issues with monitoring and gradual optimization
- **TECH-001**: Integration issues with comprehensive fallback mechanisms
- **OPS-001**: Operational complexity with manual override capabilities

### Accepted Risks

- **DATA-001**: Low-probability key recovery failures with multiple backup paths
- **BUS-001**: Minor UX impacts with user education and progressive enhancement

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

**Performance Metrics:**

- Argon2id KDF operation timing across device classes
- Key derivation hierarchy operation latency
- Memory usage during crypto operations

**Security Alerts:**

- Hardware storage access failures or anomalies
- Multi-device authentication failures
- Key rotation failures or inconsistencies
- Unusual key derivation patterns

**Operational Metrics:**

- Device registration and pairing success rates
- Key recovery success rates
- Cross-platform compatibility issues

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- New platform versions released (iOS/Android/browser updates)
- Hardware security vulnerabilities discovered in target platforms
- Cryptographic standards or recommendations change
- Performance regressions detected in production
- New device classes or capabilities introduced
- Security incidents affecting key management systems

## Integration with Quality Gates

**Gate Decision Mapping:**

- SEC-001 (Score 9) → **FAIL** (unless waived by security team)
- SEC-002, SEC-003, PERF-001 (Score 6) → **CONCERNS**
- Overall Risk Score 74/100 → **CONCERNS** (requires mitigation plan)

**Unmitigated High Risks**: Document security audit requirements and performance optimization plan in gate decision.

## Risk Scoring Details

**Base Score**: 100
**Deductions**:

- Critical (9): -20 points (SEC-001)
- High (6): -10 points each (SEC-002, SEC-003, PERF-001) = -30 points
- Medium (4): -5 points each (TECH-001, OPS-001) = -10 points
- Low (2-3): -2 points each (DATA-001, BUS-001) = -4 points

**Final Score**: 100 - 20 - 30 - 10 - 4 = **74/100**

## Conclusion

Story 1.4 presents **moderate-to-high risk** due to critical hardware security implementation challenges. The primary concern is platform-specific secure storage implementation (SEC-001) which requires immediate security audit attention. High-risk areas around multi-device protocols and key derivation also need comprehensive testing before production deployment.

**Recommended Approach**: Phased implementation with security-first validation, starting with single-device scenarios before enabling multi-device capabilities.
