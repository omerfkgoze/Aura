Date: 2025-09-19
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 6
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 2
- Risk Score: 69/100 (calculated)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. [TECH-001]: Dependency Version Conflicts

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - React 19 version mismatches already documented in story requirements
**Impact**: High - Dependency conflicts can break entire build pipeline and block all development work

**Mitigation**:

- Immediate dependency audit with `pnpm list --depth=0` across all workspace packages
- Update React to consistent version (19.x) using pnpm overrides in root package.json
- Implement exact version matching for critical dependencies like Tamagui, TypeScript
- Test package resolution integrity with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`

**Testing Focus**: Clean install testing, build verification across all packages, dependency graph analysis

## Risk Distribution

### By Category

- Technical: 3 risks (1 critical, 1 high, 1 medium)
- Operational: 2 risks (1 high, 1 low)
- Data: 1 risk (1 medium)

### By Component

- Workspace Root: 2 risks (dependency management, build config)
- TypeScript Configuration: 1 risk (config misalignment)
- Development Servers: 1 risk (startup instability)
- Existing Functionality: 1 risk (regression potential)
- Package Management: 1 risk (installation conflicts)

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- **Dependency Resolution Testing**:
  - Clean install from scratch: `rm -rf node_modules && pnpm install`
  - Lockfile integrity validation
  - Cross-package version compatibility verification
  - Build success across all workspace packages

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- **TypeScript Configuration Testing**:
  - Workspace-wide type checking: `nx run-many --target=type-check`
  - Strict mode compliance validation
  - IDE TypeScript service verification
  - Build-time type checking validation

- **Development Server Testing**:
  - Multi-platform startup testing (web + mobile)
  - Port conflict simulation and resolution
  - Process management and graceful shutdown
  - Hot reloading functionality verification

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- **Build Pipeline Testing**:
  - Nx build optimization verification
  - Vite and Metro bundler configuration validation
  - Build script execution without warnings

- **Regression Testing**:
  - Existing UI component rendering verification
  - Crypto-core WASM integration testing
  - Database-security services functionality
  - Shared component library loading

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- **TECH-001**: Dependency Version Conflicts (Critical - Score 9)
  - All workspace packages must install and build successfully
  - No version conflicts in dependency tree

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- **TECH-002**: TypeScript Configuration Misalignment (High - Score 6)
  - Can deploy if type checking passes, even with minor config differences
  - Must have monitoring for type-related runtime errors

- **OPS-001**: Development Server Instability (High - Score 6)
  - Can proceed if manual startup procedures are documented
  - Must have automated health checks in place

### Accepted Risks

- **TECH-003**: Minor build configuration drift acceptable with performance monitoring
- **OPS-002**: Package installation conflicts acceptable with PNPM override strategy
- **DATA-001**: Minimal regression risk acceptable with comprehensive testing

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **Build Performance**: Track build times and success rates across packages
- **Development Experience**: Monitor server startup success rates and developer productivity metrics
- **Type Safety**: Track TypeScript error counts and type-related runtime issues
- **Dependency Health**: Monitor for new security vulnerabilities and version drift

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- New dependencies are added to any workspace package
- TypeScript version is upgraded
- Nx or build tool versions are updated
- New packages are added to the monorepo workspace
- Development server architecture changes

## Risk-Based Recommendations

### Testing Priority

1. **Immediate**: Dependency resolution and build verification testing
2. **High**: TypeScript configuration and development server stability testing
3. **Medium**: Performance and regression testing

### Development Focus

1. **Code Review Emphasis**: Package.json changes, TypeScript configuration modifications
2. **Additional Validation**: Dependency audit tools, automated build verification
3. **Security Controls**: PNPM overrides for known vulnerabilities

### Deployment Strategy

1. **Phased Approach**: Fix critical dependency issues first, then configuration alignment
2. **Feature Flags**: Not applicable for infrastructure changes
3. **Rollback Procedures**: Git-based rollback with clean dependency reinstall

### Monitoring Setup

1. **Metrics**: Build success rates, type error counts, server startup times
2. **Alerts**: Build failures, dependency security alerts, server startup failures
3. **Dashboards**: Development environment health, dependency vulnerability status
