2. **User Experience Design**: Progressive disclosure, guided tours, cultural adaptations
3. **Monitoring Implementation**: Real-time performance and accuracy monitoring
4. **Security Validation**: Client-side data handling review

### Deployment Strategy

1. **Phased Rollout**: Start with limited user base for performance validation
2. **Feature Flags**: Enable uncertainty features progressively based on performance metrics
3. **Rollback Procedures**: Immediate rollback if performance degrades below 60fps
4. **A/B Testing**: Test explanation complexity levels with different user segments

### Monitoring Setup

1. **Performance Dashboard**: Real-time visualization of calculation and rendering performance

3. **User Experience Dashboard**: Feature usage, confusion indicators, cultural adaptation effectiveness
4. **Alert Configuration**: Performance degradation, accuracy drift, high error rates

## Gate Decision Impact

**Recommended Gate Status: CONCERNS**

Rationale: One critical risk (PERF-001) and three high risks require mitigation before production deployment. Performance optimization and user experience validation are essential for success.
