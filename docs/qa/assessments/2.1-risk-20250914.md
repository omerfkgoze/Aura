Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)  
Story: 2.1.encrypted-local-database-implementation

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 5
- Critical Risks: 1 (SEC-001)
- High Risks: 2 (SEC-002, DATA-001)
- Medium Risks: 2 (PERF-001, OPS-001)
- **Risk Score: 62/100** (High Risk Implementation)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-001: Encryption Key Exposure

**Score: 9 (Critical)**  
**Probability**: High (3) - SQLCipher/Realm encryption keys stored in memory are vulnerable to dump attacks, WASM boundary crossings increase exposure surface, mobile apps susceptible to memory inspection tools  
**Impact**: High (3) - Complete compromise of encrypted database, exposure of all health data, violation of zero-knowledge architecture

**Mitigation**:

- Implement mandatory memory zeroization in Rust crypto-core for all key material
- Add WASM boundary memory lifecycle auditing and cleanup
- Enforce hardware keystore usage (iOS SecureEnclave, Android Keystore) with no software fallbacks
- Implement key derivation directly in hardware security modules where possible

**Testing Focus**:

- Memory dump analysis during key operations
- WASM memory boundary leak testing
- Hardware keystore integration validation
- Key lifecycle and cleanup verification

## High Risks Requiring Attention Before Production

### 2. SEC-002: Duress Protection Bypass

**Score: 6 (High)**  
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Sophisticated attackers may reverse engineer duress mechanisms, biometric spoofing possible, PIN patterns may be predictable  
**Impact**: High (3) - Complete bypass of emergency data protection, forensic data recovery possible, user safety compromise

**Mitigation**:

- Implement multiple independent duress triggers (PIN + biometric + pattern sequence)
- Use cryptographic secure deletion with multiple overwrite passes
- Add anti-forensics protective deletion patterns
- Create tamper-evident duress activation logging

**Testing Focus**:

- Forensic analysis resistance testing
- Duress trigger reliability across platforms
- Secure deletion verification and recovery prevention

### 3. DATA-001: Database Corruption During Migration

**Score: 6 (High)**  
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Complex encrypted migrations are error-prone, schema changes affect encrypted data structure, rollback mechanisms untested  
**Impact**: High (3) - Complete data loss, corrupted health records, inability to recover encrypted data

**Mitigation**:

- Implement atomic migration transactions with guaranteed rollback
- Create pre-migration integrity snapshots with verification checksums
- Add migration validation and corruption detection mechanisms
- Implement incremental migration with checkpoint recovery

**Testing Focus**:

- Migration stress testing with various failure scenarios
- Corruption recovery and rollback verification
- Multi-version migration path validation

## Medium Risks - Monitor and Mitigate

### 4. PERF-001: Encryption Performance Bottleneck

**Score: 4 (Medium)**  
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Mobile CPUs vary in crypto acceleration, large datasets increase encryption time, battery drain considerations  
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Poor user experience, app responsiveness issues, battery drain

**Mitigation**:

- Implement async encryption operations with progress indicators
- Add database query optimization for encrypted data
- Use hardware crypto acceleration where available
- Implement smart caching for frequently accessed encrypted data

### 5. OPS-001: Platform Integration Failures

**Score: 4 (Medium)**  
**Probability**: Medium (2) - iOS/Android keystore APIs differ significantly, OS version compatibility issues, hardware variation across devices  
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Platform-specific failures, reduced security on unsupported devices

**Mitigation**:

- Comprehensive platform-specific testing matrices
- Graceful degradation strategies for unsupported hardware
- Platform-specific fallback mechanisms with security warnings
- Regular testing against latest OS versions

## Risk Distribution

### By Category

- Security: 2 risks (1 critical, 1 high)
- Data: 1 risk (1 high)
- Performance: 1 risk (1 medium)
- Operational: 1 risk (1 medium)

### By Component

- Crypto Core: 2 risks (SEC-001, PERF-001)
- Database System: 2 risks (DATA-001, PERF-001)
- Platform Integration: 2 risks (SEC-002, OPS-001)
- Duress System: 1 risk (SEC-002)

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests (SEC-001)

- **Memory Security Testing**: Memory dump analysis during key operations, WASM boundary leak detection
- **Hardware Integration Testing**: SecureEnclave/Keystore mandatory usage validation
- **Key Lifecycle Testing**: Proper key zeroization and cleanup verification

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests (SEC-002, DATA-001)

- **Duress Protection Testing**: Multi-trigger functionality, secure deletion verification, forensic resistance
- **Migration Testing**: Atomic transaction rollback, corruption recovery, multi-version migration paths
- **Data Integrity Testing**: Checksum validation, tamper detection, backup consistency

### Priority 3: Medium Risk Tests (PERF-001, OPS-001)

- **Performance Testing**: Encryption/decryption benchmarks, battery impact analysis, responsiveness validation
- **Platform Testing**: Cross-platform compatibility, OS version support, hardware variation testing
- **Integration Testing**: API compatibility, fallback mechanism validation

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- **SEC-001**: All critical memory exposure risks with hardware keystore enforcement
- **SEC-002**: Complete duress protection system with forensic resistance testing
- **DATA-001**: Robust migration system with verified rollback capabilities

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- **PERF-001**: Performance optimization with acceptable user experience thresholds
- **OPS-001**: Platform-specific testing coverage with documented limitations

### Accepted Risks

- Minor performance degradation on older devices (with user notification)
- Limited functionality on devices without hardware security features (with security warnings)

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **Memory Usage Patterns**: Unusual memory allocation during crypto operations
- **Performance Metrics**: Encryption/decryption latencies, app responsiveness
- **Security Events**: Failed duress activations, keystore access patterns
- **Data Integrity**: Corruption detection alerts, migration failure rates
- **Platform Issues**: OS-specific crash rates, hardware compatibility problems

## Risk Review Triggers

Update risk profile when:

- Crypto-core library updates or architectural changes
- New mobile OS versions released with keystore changes
- Security vulnerability discoveries in SQLCipher/Realm
- Performance issues reported from production users
- New regulatory requirements affecting health data encryption

## Quality Gate Recommendation

**CONCERNS** - Story has 1 critical risk (SEC-001) and 2 high risks requiring immediate attention before production deployment. Critical memory security issues must be resolved with hardware keystore enforcement and comprehensive testing.
