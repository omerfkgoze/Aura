Date: 2025-09-19
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 6
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 1
- Risk Score: 84/100 (Good)

## High Risks Requiring Attention

### 1. TECH-001: Tamagui Next.js 15.x Compatibility Issues

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Tamagui with Next.js 15.x is a newer combination with potential SSR/hydration issues
**Impact**: High - Could block entire web platform foundation implementation
**Mitigation**:

- Test Tamagui components with Next.js 15.x SSR before full implementation
- Verify hydration behavior works correctly with Tamagui provider
- Create fallback UI components for unsupported features
- Document any compatibility workarounds needed

**Testing Focus**: SSR rendering tests, hydration validation, component integration tests

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests

- **Tamagui Integration Tests**
  - SSR component rendering verification
  - Client-side hydration validation
  - Theme provider functionality
  - Cross-browser compatibility with Next.js 15.x

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

- **Responsive Design Tests**
  - Breakpoint behavior across devices (320px, 768px, 1024px+)
  - Component layout adaptation
  - Touch target accessibility on mobile
- **Performance Tests**
  - Bundle size analysis with Tamagui integration
  - Initial page load metrics
  - Component tree-shaking effectiveness

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests

- **Build Validation Tests**
  - TypeScript compilation success
  - Development server startup
  - Production build verification

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- TECH-001: Tamagui compatibility must be verified and working

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- TECH-002: Responsive design with documented breakpoint strategy
- PERF-001: Bundle size with monitoring and optimization plan

### Accepted Risks

- BUS-001: Cultural preset foundation as placeholder (acceptable for foundation story)
- TECH-003: Minor TypeScript issues with documented resolution plan
- OPS-001: Build complications with fallback procedures

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **Performance metrics**: Bundle size, page load times, hydration timing
- **Error rates**: Component rendering failures, SSR errors
- **User experience**: Responsive design issues across devices
- **Build stability**: CI/CD success rates, development server reliability

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Tamagui version updates or Next.js framework changes
- New responsive design requirements or device support
- Performance budget changes or bundle size thresholds
- Cultural preset requirements become more specific
- Build process or deployment pipeline changes

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Create Tamagui + Next.js 15.x compatibility test suite
   - Establish bundle size monitoring baseline
   - Document responsive design breakpoint strategy

2. **Development Focus**
   - Prioritize Tamagui SSR testing early in Task 2
   - Implement progressive enhancement for responsive design
   - Use TypeScript strict mode throughout development

3. **Testing Emphasis**
   - Focus 60% of testing effort on Tamagui integration
   - 25% on responsive design validation
   - 15% on build process and performance

4. **Quality Gates**
   - All Tamagui components must render correctly in SSR
   - Bundle size must not exceed baseline + 20%
   - All responsive breakpoints must function correctly
