## Integration with Quality Gates

**Gate Determination Logic**:

- 4 High risks (score 6) → **CONCERNS** gate status
- No Critical risks (score 9) → Prevents FAIL status
- Comprehensive mitigation strategies documented → Supports deployment readiness
- Risk monitoring plan established → Enables production confidence

**Recommendations for Gate Review**:

1. **Priority focus**: Address high-priority security and performance risks first
2. **Testing emphasis**: Extensive security validation and cross-platform performance testing required
3. **Documentation**: Complete risk mitigation implementation before production deployment
4. **Monitoring setup**: Establish comprehensive post-deployment risk monitoring
