## High Risks Requiring Priority Attention

### 1. SEC-001: P2P Encryption Key Compromise

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Device-to-device key exchange protocols are complex and prone to implementation vulnerabilities
**Impact**: High - Compromised P2P keys could expose health data during synchronization
**Mitigation**:

- Implement secure handshake with certificate pinning and mutual authentication

- Add device trust verification with manual pairing confirmation
  **Testing Focus**: Security penetration testing of P2P communication, key exchange vulnerability assessment

### 2. DATA-001: Cross-Device Sync Conflict Data Loss

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - Multiple devices editing same data simultaneously is common user behavior
**Impact**: Medium - User could lose cycle data entries without proper conflict resolution
**Mitigation**:

- Implement robust last-write-wins with version timestamps
- Create user-friendly conflict resolution UI with data preview
- Add automatic backup before conflict resolution
  **Testing Focus**: Multi-device simultaneous editing scenarios, conflict detection accuracy testing

### 3. PERF-001: Large Dataset Sync Performance Degradation

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - Users with years of cycle data will experience large sync operations
**Impact**: Medium - Slow sync affects user experience and battery life
**Mitigation**:

- Implement incremental sync with delta compression
- Add sync progress indicators and background processing
- Optimize database queries for sync operations
  **Testing Focus**: Load testing with large datasets, background sync performance validation

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests

**Security Testing (SEC-001)**

- Man-in-the-middle attack simulation during P2P handshake
- Key exchange vulnerability assessment with security tools
- Device trust verification bypass attempts
- Forward secrecy validation with key rotation testing

**Data Integrity Testing (DATA-001)**

- Simultaneous multi-device editing with complex conflict scenarios
- Data loss detection during conflict resolution processes
- Version control accuracy across multiple devices
- Backup restoration testing after failed conflict resolution

**Performance Testing (PERF-001)**

- Large dataset sync with 5+ years of cycle data
- Background sync performance with limited battery/CPU
- Network interruption during large sync operations
- Memory usage monitoring during sync operations

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

**Technical Infrastructure (TECH-001)**

- P2P device discovery across different network configurations
- Fallback mechanism testing when discovery fails
- Cross-platform discovery (iOS-Android) validation

**User Experience (BUS-001)**

- Conflict resolution interface usability testing
- User comprehension of sync status indicators
- Error message clarity and actionability

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests

**Operational Monitoring (OPS-001)**

- Network state detection accuracy across connection types
- Offline-to-online transition handling
- Sync queue management during connectivity changes

**Security Isolation (SEC-002)**

- Backup key isolation verification
- Primary key separation validation
- Hardware security module integration testing

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- SEC-001: P2P encryption must use secure handshake with ephemeral keys
- DATA-001: Conflict resolution must prevent data loss with user confirmation
- PERF-001: Large dataset sync must complete within acceptable timeframes

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- TECH-001: P2P discovery can use fallback manual pairing
- BUS-001: Complex UX acceptable with user documentation

### Accepted Risks

- OPS-001: Minor network detection delays acceptable with retry logic
- SEC-002: Backup key isolation sufficient with current secure enclave implementation

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **P2P Security**: Failed handshake attempts, key exchange errors
- **Sync Performance**: Sync completion times, background task duration
- **Data Integrity**: Conflict resolution success rates, data validation failures
- **Network Handling**: Connection state accuracy, offline mode usage
- **User Experience**: Conflict resolution abandonment rates, error frequencies

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- P2P communication protocol changes
- New device platforms added (e.g., web app)
- Security vulnerabilities discovered in crypto libraries
- User reports of data loss during sync
- Performance degradation reports from users

## Integration with Quality Gates

**Risk-Based Gate Decision:**

- High risks (score ≥ 6): Requires explicit mitigation plan and testing completion
- Medium risks (score 4): Monitor during implementation
- Low risks (score ≤ 3): Document and accept with basic mitigation

**Recommended Gate Status:** CONCERNS

- Reason: 3 high-risk items require comprehensive mitigation and testing
- Unblocking conditions: Security testing completion, conflict resolution validation, performance benchmarking
