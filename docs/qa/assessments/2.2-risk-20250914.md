Date: 2025-09-14
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 7
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 3
- Risk Score: 62/100 (moderate risk level requiring attention)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-002: Memory Plaintext Data Exposure

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Real-time data entry operations may leave sensitive health data in unprotected memory
**Impact**: High - Plaintext menstrual cycle data exposure could compromise user privacy and violate zero-knowledge architecture
**Mitigation**:

- Implement secure memory allocation for all data entry operations
- Add immediate zeroization after encryption operations
- Use memory-mapped files with proper cleanup
- Validate no plaintext persistence through memory dumps

**Testing Focus**:

- Memory dumping tests during data entry
- Static code analysis for memory safety
- Runtime memory pattern validation

| TECH-002 | Technical   | Calendar cultural adaptation complex | 3    | 1      | 3     | Low      |
| PERF-002 | Performance | Batch import UI freezing             | 2    | 1      | 2     | Low      |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

**SEC-002 Memory Safety Tests:**

- Memory dump analysis during active data entry
- Valgrind/AddressSanitizer integration for memory leak detection
- Runtime memory pattern validation for plaintext data
- Static code analysis for secure memory usage patterns

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

**Encryption & Key Management Tests:**

- Encryption failure simulation and graceful degradation
- Key rotation and hardware-backed storage validation
- Performance benchmarking under realistic mobile constraints
- Concurrent encryption operation stress testing

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

**Data Consistency & UI Tests:**

- Concurrent data entry conflict resolution
- Cultural calendar adaptation across locales
- Batch import progress indication and error recovery
- Cross-platform UI component behavior validation

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- SEC-002: Critical memory safety issue - MANDATORY FIX
- DATA-004: Encryption failure handling must be robust
- SEC-001: Key management security must meet enterprise standards

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- PERF-001: Performance issues acceptable with monitoring dashboards
- DATA-002: Concurrent conflicts manageable with proper UX messaging

### Accepted Risks

- TECH-002: Cultural adaptation complexity - progressive enhancement approach
- PERF-002: Minor UI freezing during batch operations - acceptable UX trade-off

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **Performance metrics**: Encryption operation latency, memory usage patterns
- **Security alerts**: Key management events, memory allocation failures
- **Error rates**: Data entry validation failures, encryption errors
- **Business KPIs**: Data entry completion rates, user retention metrics

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Crypto-core library updates or security patches applied
- New mobile platform versions requiring compatibility updates
- Performance benchmarks fall below acceptable thresholds
- Security vulnerabilities discovered in encryption dependencies
- User privacy regulations change requiring architecture updates

## Risk-Based Development Focus

### Code Review Emphasis Areas

1. **Memory Safety**: All data entry and encryption code paths
2. **Error Handling**: Encryption failure scenarios and user feedback
3. **Performance**: Real-time operation optimization strategies
4. **Security**: Key management and cryptographic implementation

### Additional Validation Required

- Penetration testing of client-side encryption implementation
- Performance testing under resource-constrained mobile environments
- Accessibility validation for data entry interfaces
- Cross-platform compatibility validation across iOS/Android versions

### Deployment Strategy

- **Phased Rollout**: Begin with limited beta users for encryption validation
- **Feature Flags**: Enable progressive rollout of complex data entry features
- **Rollback Procedures**: Immediate rollback capability for critical security issues

## Integration with Quality Gates

**Gate Decision Logic:**

- SEC-002 (Score 9) without mitigation → **FAIL**
- 3 High risks (Score 6) → **CONCERNS**
- With proper mitigation plan → **CONDITIONAL PASS**

**Current Recommendation**: **CONCERNS** - Critical memory safety issue requires resolution before production deployment.

## Overall Risk Assessment

Story 2.2 presents **moderate to high risk** due to the combination of sensitive health data handling, real-time encryption requirements, and complex UI interactions. The critical memory safety risk (SEC-002) is the primary blocker requiring immediate attention.

**Risk Score: 62/100** - Indicates need for focused risk mitigation before production readiness.
