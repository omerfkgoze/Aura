## Quality Gate Integration

**Risk-Based Gate Decision: CONCERNS**

**Rationale:**

- 3 Critical risks requiring mitigation before production deployment
- High complexity security framework needs extensive validation
- Potential for false positives affecting development workflow
- Strong implementation foundation (320+ tests) provides confidence but requires risk mitigation

**Gate Requirements:**

- Must address all critical risks with documented mitigation plans
- Performance impact must be measured and within acceptable thresholds
- Comprehensive testing coverage for all identified risk scenarios
- Operational support procedures must be documented and validated
