## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. [DATA-002]: Incomplete migration leaving mixed encryption states

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Progressive migration interruptions likely with large datasets

**Mitigation**:

- Implement atomic migration operations with full rollback capability
- Add migration progress checkpoints enabling resumability from any point
- Create comprehensive data integrity validation at each migration step
- Use database transactions ensuring migration consistency across all operations

**Testing Focus**: End-to-end migration testing with forced interruptions, rollback validation, data integrity verification

### 2. [TECH-002]: Cross-device state synchronization race conditions

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Multiple devices rotating simultaneously creates inevitable race conditions
**Impact**: High - Device state inconsistency causes data inaccessibility across devices
**Mitigation**:

- Implement distributed locking mechanisms for cross-device rotation operations
- Use distributed consensus algorithms for rotation state management
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff for failed synchronizations
- Create conflict resolution protocols for concurrent rotation attempts

**Testing Focus**: Concurrent device testing, network partition scenarios, race condition simulation

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

**DATA-002 Migration Integrity Tests**:

- Forced interruption testing during various migration phases
- Power failure simulation during re-encryption
- Network disconnection during cross-device sync
- Database transaction rollback validation
- Data consistency verification across all migration states

**TECH-002 Concurrency Tests**:

- Multiple device simultaneous rotation testing
- Network partition testing with delayed synchronization
- Race condition simulation with automated conflict generation
- Distributed lock timeout and recovery testing
- State consistency validation across device clusters

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

**Security Tests**:

- Key derivation strength validation during emergency rotation
- Timing analysis of rotation operations to detect patterns
- Cross-device key exposure testing during synchronization failures
- Authentication bypass testing during emergency scenarios

**Performance Tests**:

- Large dataset (10GB+) migration performance testing
- Emergency rotation response time under various load conditions
- UI responsiveness during background re-encryption
- Memory usage optimization during batch operations

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

**Operational Tests**:

- Recovery procedure validation for various failure scenarios
- False positive detection and user experience testing
- Audit trail integrity and tamper detection
- User notification system reliability testing

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- **DATA-002**: Incomplete migration states (Critical - data integrity)
- **TECH-002**: Cross-device race conditions (Critical - system consistency)
- All high-priority security risks (SEC-001, SEC-003)

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Performance risks with user controls and progress indicators
- Operational risks with comprehensive monitoring and alerts

### Accepted Risks

- Minor user disruption during rotation (with proper notification)
- Potential trust impact (mitigated by transparent communication)

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **Migration Progress**: Real-time migration status, failure rates, rollback frequency
- **Cross-Device Sync**: Device synchronization health, conflict resolution success
- **Key Rotation Health**: Rotation completion rates, emergency trigger accuracy
- **Performance Metrics**: Migration performance, UI responsiveness during operations
- **Security Alerts**: Unusual rotation patterns, potential timing attacks
- **Audit Trail**: Rotation event completeness, trail integrity validation

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- New device types added to synchronization matrix
- Emergency rotation triggers modified or expanded
- Data migration algorithms changed or optimized
- Cross-device communication protocols updated
- Cryptographic libraries upgraded or replaced
- Security incidents involving key rotation discovered

## Integration with Quality Gates

**Gate Recommendation**: **FAIL** - Two critical risks with score 9 require resolution before deployment

**Risk Score**: 0/100 (Extremely Risky)

- Critical risks present data integrity and system consistency threats
- High-risk security vulnerabilities could compromise zero-knowledge guarantees
- Mitigation strategies require significant architectural changes

**Required Actions**:

1. Implement atomic migration with full rollback capability
2. Design distributed consensus for cross-device synchronization
3. Create comprehensive concurrency testing framework
4. Validate all security assumptions with penetration testing
