- Risk Score: 55/100 (Moderate-High Risk)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-001: Cryptographic Implementation Vulnerabilities

**Score: 9 (Critical)**

**Probability**: High - Complex cryptographic implementation with libsodium bindings, memory hygiene, and crypto envelope structures presents multiple attack vectors.

**Impact**: High - Any vulnerability in core cryptographic functions would compromise the entire zero-knowledge architecture and all user data security.

**Mitigation**:

- Implement extensive property-based testing covering all input ranges and edge cases
- Conduct formal cryptographic security audit by certified third party
- Use proven cryptographic libraries (libsodium) without custom crypto implementations
- Implement comprehensive fuzzing tests for all crypto functions
- Add constant-time operation verification to prevent timing attacks
- Create comprehensive audit trail for all cryptographic operations

**Testing Focus**:

- Property-based testing with millions of random inputs
- Side-channel attack testing with timing analysis
- Memory safety testing with AddressSanitizer/Valgrind
- Cross-platform cryptographic consistency verification

## High Priority Risks

### 2. SEC-002: Memory Side-Channel Attacks

**Score: 6 (High)**

**Probability**: Medium - WASM/JavaScript boundary creates potential for memory-based side-channel attacks, especially with automatic memory management.

**Impact**: High - Memory side-channels could expose private keys or sensitive cryptographic material.

**Mitigation**:

- Implement immediate zeroization of all cryptographic material
- Use memory protection with stack canaries and buffer overflow prevention
- Validate memory hygiene across WASM/JavaScript boundary
- Implement secure memory allocation patterns
- Add memory access auditing and leak detection

**Testing Focus**: Memory leak detection, timing analysis, secure memory cleanup verification

### 3. TECH-001: Cross-Language Memory Management

**Score: 6 (High)**

**Probability**: High - Complex memory management between Rust WASM and JavaScript creates high potential for memory leaks, use-after-free, or double-free errors.

**Impact**: Medium - Memory management issues could lead to application crashes, memory leaks, or undefined behavior.

**Mitigation**:

- Implement comprehensive memory management testing
- Use RAII patterns in Rust for automatic cleanup
- Add memory leak detection in CI pipeline
- Create clear ownership transfer patterns at language boundaries
- Implement proper error handling for memory allocation failures

**Testing Focus**: Memory leak detection, boundary testing, resource cleanup validation

### 4. PERF-001: Crypto Operation Timeout Risk

**Score: 6 (High)**

**Probability**: High - The 500ms target for crypto operations is aggressive, especially for mobile devices with limited computational resources.

**Impact**: Medium - Performance issues would degrade user experience and potentially make the application unusable on slower devices.

**Mitigation**:

- Implement progressive optimization based on device capabilities
- Add crypto operation caching where security permits
- Use WebAssembly SIMD instructions where available
- Implement timeout handling with graceful degradation
- Add performance monitoring and alerting

**Testing Focus**: Performance benchmarking across device types, timeout scenario testing, progressive optimization validation

## Medium Priority Risks

### 5. TECH-002: TypeScript Binding Generation Errors

**Score: 4 (Medium)**

**Mitigation**: Extensive testing of auto-generated bindings, manual verification of critical interfaces

### 6. TECH-003: Platform Compatibility Issues

**Score: 4 (Medium)**

**Mitigation**: Cross-platform testing matrix, platform-specific optimization validation

### 7. PERF-002: Bundle Size Limit Exceedance

**Score: 4 (Medium)**

**Mitigation**: WASM size optimization, lazy loading implementation, bundle analysis integration

### 8. SEC-003: WASM Module Integrity Bypass

**Score: 3 (Low)**

**Mitigation**: Implement WASM integrity verification, secure module loading patterns

**Memory Management (SEC-002, TECH-001):**

- AddressSanitizer/Valgrind integration in CI
- Memory leak detection with detailed reporting
- Boundary testing at WASM/JavaScript interface
- Stress testing with high-frequency crypto operations

**Performance Testing (PERF-001):**

- Benchmarking across iOS/Android/Web platforms
- Device capability-based performance validation
- Timeout scenario testing with graceful degradation
- Resource usage monitoring and alerting

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

**Platform Compatibility:**

- Cross-platform integration test matrix
- TypeScript binding validation tests
- Bundle size monitoring with alerts
- WASM integrity verification tests

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- SEC-001: All cryptographic vulnerabilities must be resolved
- SEC-002: Memory side-channel protections must be verified
