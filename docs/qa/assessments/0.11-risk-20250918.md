Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 8
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 2
- Medium Risks: 3
- Low Risks: 3
- Risk Score: 69/100 (Moderate Risk)

## High Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. TECH-001: Metro Bundler Monorepo Integration Complexity

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - Metro bundler historically has complexity with monorepo structures, especially with Nx workspace patterns
**Impact**: Medium - Will slow development workflow and cause developer frustration
**Mitigation**:

- Configure Metro bundler with explicit monorepo resolver settings
- Test Metro configuration with all shared packages before deployment
- Create Metro troubleshooting documentation
- Consider fallback strategies (webpack dev server for mobile testing)
  **Testing Focus**:
- Test `npx expo start` with all shared packages loaded
- Verify hot reload works across monorepo boundaries
- Test Metro memory usage under load

### 2. TECH-002: Cross-Platform Package Resolution Failures

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Tamagui and shared packages have different resolution patterns on web vs mobile
**Impact**: High - Breaks both platforms, blocks entire development workflow
**Mitigation**:

- Implement consistent TypeScript path mapping across platforms
- Test package resolution in both Vite and Metro environments
- Create unified package.json workspace configuration
- Verify Tamagui components render identically on both platforms
  **Testing Focus**:
- Cross-platform component rendering tests
- Package import resolution verification
- Shared types consistency checks

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests

**TECH-001 & TECH-002 Critical Path Testing:**

- Metro bundler integration with all monorepo packages
- Cross-platform package resolution verification
- Tamagui component consistency across platforms
- Hot reload functionality testing
- Error handling and debugging capability verification

**Required Test Environment:**

- Fresh development environment setup
- Multiple developer machines for consistency testing
- Both iOS and Android simulators + web browsers

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

**Development Environment Integration:**

- WASM bindings loading in development mode
- Memory usage profiling during development
- Documentation accuracy verification
- Concurrent mobile and web development testing

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests

**Production Build Verification:**

- Regression testing for existing build functionality
- Secret exposure scanning in development logs
- Performance baseline establishment for hot reload

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- TECH-001: Metro bundler must work reliably with monorepo
- TECH-002: Cross-platform package resolution must be consistent

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- TECH-003: WASM bindings can fail gracefully in development
- PERF-002: Memory usage can be managed with documentation
- OPS-001: Documentation can be improved iteratively

### Accepted Risks

- SEC-001: Development secret exposure risk accepted with monitoring
- PERF-001: Hot reload performance degradation acceptable for development
- OPS-002: Production build regression risk mitigated by CI testing

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **Performance Metrics**: Metro bundler memory usage, hot reload times
- **Error Rates**: Package resolution failures, development server crashes
- **Developer Experience**: Setup success rates, troubleshooting frequency
- **Build Metrics**: Production build success rates, regression indicators

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Metro bundler configuration changes significantly
- New shared packages added to monorepo
- Tamagui or Next.js major version updates
- Developer workflow complaints increase
- Production build failures related to development changes

## Mitigation Action Plan

### Immediate Actions (Before Development Starts)

1. **Configure Metro Bundler** with explicit monorepo resolver
2. **Test Cross-Platform Resolution** with sample Tamagui components
3. **Create Development Setup Guide** with troubleshooting section

### Ongoing Monitoring (During Development)

1. **Monitor Metro Memory Usage** and performance
2. **Track Developer Setup Success Rate**
3. **Validate Production Build Integrity** in CI/CD

### Contingency Plans

1. **Metro Fallback**: Use webpack dev server for mobile development if Metro fails
2. **Package Resolution Fallback**: Implement manual path resolution if automatic fails
3. **Documentation Escalation**: Create video tutorials if written docs insufficient

## Risk-Based Recommendations

### Testing Priority

1. **Critical Path Testing**: Metro + package resolution integration
2. **Cross-Platform Validation**: Tamagui component consistency
3. **Performance Baseline**: Establish acceptable development performance

### Development Focus

1. **Configuration Robustness**: Ensure Metro and Vite configs are resilient
2. **Error Handling**: Implement clear error messages for common setup issues
3. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive troubleshooting guides

### Deployment Strategy

1. **Incremental Rollout**: Test with small group of developers first
2. **Fallback Procedures**: Maintain previous development setup as backup
3. **Support Structure**: Ensure senior developers available for setup assistance

## Integration with Quality Gates

**Gate Decision Mapping:**

- High risks (TECH-001, TECH-002) require mitigation before PASS
- Medium risks acceptable with monitoring
- Current risk profile suggests: **CONCERNS** (due to 2 high risks)

### Recommended Gate Decision: CONCERNS

**Rationale**: Two high-priority technical risks require mitigation before full approval, but development can proceed with proper monitoring and fallback plans in place.
