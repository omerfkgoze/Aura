# Gate decision rationale:
# Developer addressed all critical security concerns with professional-grade implementations:
# - Secure crypto using cryptographically secure rand crate
# - Timing attack resistance verified through statistical testing
# - Automated security pipeline with daily audits
# - Memory safety with proper zeroization
# Only non-critical performance benchmarking remains for future optimization
