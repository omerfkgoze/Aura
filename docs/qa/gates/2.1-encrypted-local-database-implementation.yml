# Quality gate decision summary
decision_summary: |
  Story 2.1 represents exceptional implementation quality with comprehensive security architecture.

  Key strengths:
  - Complete implementation of all 7 acceptance criteria
  - Enterprise-grade security with AES-256 encryption and hardware keystore integration
  - Comprehensive duress protection and forensic resistance capabilities
  - Production-ready error handling and resource management
  - Strong adherence to zero-knowledge architecture principles
  - Excellent code organization and maintainability

  The implementation demonstrates deep understanding of mobile security requirements
  and provides a solid foundation for subsequent cycle data entry and prediction features.

  No issues identified that would prevent production deployment.

  RECOMMENDATION: Ready for Done status.
