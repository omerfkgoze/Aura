# Epic 1: Foundation & Privacy Infrastructure

**Epic Goal:** Establish secure database infrastructure, build the core cryptographic infrastructure with Rust/WASM implementation, Passkeys + OPAQUE authentication system, and key rotation framework while delivering a demonstrable health-check interface that validates end-to-end encryption capabilities.

## Story 1.1: Database Infrastructure and Security Setup

As a security-focused backend developer,
I want a properly configured PostgreSQL database with Row Level Security and encrypted backup systems,
so that all user data is isolated and protected before any application logic is implemented.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Supabase Database Configuration**
   - Database project properly configured with RLS enabled by default
   - Connection pooling configured with appropriate limits for expected load
   - Database backup and point-in-time recovery configured
   - SSL/TLS enforcement for all database connections

2. **Row Level Security Policies**
   - User isolation policies preventing cross-user data access
   - Service role policies for admin operations and health checks
   - Anonymous role restrictions for public operations only
   - Policy testing framework ensuring RLS enforcement

3. **Database Schema Foundation**
   - Users table with proper UUID primary keys and security fields
   - Encrypted data tables with proper indexing strategies
   - Audit trail tables for security-sensitive operations
   - Database migration framework using Supabase CLI

4. **Local Development Database**
   - Docker Compose PostgreSQL setup matching production schema
   - Development seed data scripts with anonymized test data
   - Database reset and migration testing workflows
   - Local RLS policy testing and validation

5. **Database Security Hardening**
   - Database user roles with principle of least privilege
   - Connection security (SSL certificates, IP allowlisting)
   - Query performance monitoring and optimization
   - Security audit logging for database access patterns

### Definition of Done

- [ ] Database schema can be deployed to staging and production environments
- [ ] RLS policies prevent unauthorized data access in all tested scenarios
- [ ] Local development database matches production security configuration
- [ ] Database backup and recovery procedures are tested and documented

## Story 1.2: Rust/WASM Crypto Core Implementation

As a privacy-focused developer,
I want a Rust/WASM cryptographic core with memory hygiene and auto-generated TypeScript bindings,
so that all sensitive operations are performed in a secure, auditable environment isolated from JavaScript.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Rust crypto library compiled to WASM with libsodium bindings for core operations
2. Memory hygiene implemented with immediate zeroization of secrets and short-lived buffers
3. Auto-generated TypeScript type definitions ensuring type safety across language boundaries
4. Crypto envelope structure implemented (version, algorithm, KDF params, salt, nonce, key ID)
5. Side-channel attack mitigations implemented (constant-time operations, timing attack prevention)
6. WASM module loading with integrity verification and secure initialization
7. Property-based testing suite validating all cryptographic operations across input ranges

## Story 1.3: Passkeys + OPAQUE Authentication System

As a security-conscious user,
I want passwordless authentication using Passkeys combined with OPAQUE protocol,
so that my authentication credentials never exist on the server and are protected by hardware security.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Passkeys registration and authentication flow implemented across all platforms
2. OPAQUE protocol integration eliminating server-side password storage
3. Hardware-backed key storage integration (iOS Keychain, Android StrongBox)
4. Fallback authentication method for devices without Passkeys support
5. Account recovery system using one-time codes with optional Shamir secret sharing
6. Cross-platform authentication state synchronization without credential exposure
7. Authentication flow testing including device loss and recovery scenarios

## Story 1.4: Device-Specific Key Management Infrastructure

As a crypto systems architect,
I want per-device encryption keys with device-class specific Argon2id tuning,
so that each device maintains independent cryptographic isolation with optimal performance.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Per-device master keys generated and stored in hardware-backed secure storage
2. Argon2id parameter auto-tuning based on device capabilities (64-256 MB memory, t=2-3)
3. Key derivation hierarchy enabling data category isolation and key rotation
4. Device registration and key exchange protocol for multi-device access
5. Key backup and recovery system integrated with Passkeys authentication
6. Key rotation skeleton framework with versioned key management
7. Performance benchmarking during setup ensuring optimal user experience

## Story 1.5: Key Rotation Framework Implementation

As a long-term security maintainer,
I want automated key rotation capabilities with seamless data migration,
so that cryptographic keys can be updated without data loss or user disruption.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Key rotation scheduling system with configurable rotation intervals
2. Backward-compatible decryption supporting multiple key versions simultaneously
3. Progressive data re-encryption with user-controlled migration timing
4. Key rotation audit trail maintaining rotation history for compliance
5. Emergency key rotation capability for security incident response
6. Cross-device key rotation synchronization without exposing keys
7. Key rotation testing framework validating migration correctness

## Story 1.6: Health-Check Encryption Validation Demo

As a zero-knowledge architecture validator,
I want a demonstrable health-check interface performing end-to-end encryption with key rotation testing,
so that the entire cryptographic pipeline can be verified and audited.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Health-check API endpoint demonstrating complete encrypt-decrypt cycle
2. Key rotation demonstration showing seamless transition between key versions
3. Multi-device encryption validation ensuring cross-device data consistency
4. Network traffic analysis validation confirming only encrypted payloads transmitted
5. Crypto envelope validation demonstrating proper metadata inclusion
6. Performance benchmarking of cryptographic operations across target devices
7. Security audit preparation documentation with complete crypto flow validation
