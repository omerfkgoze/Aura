# Epic 0: Supply-chain & Threat Modeling

**Epic Goal:** Establish comprehensive security foundation with supply-chain protection, threat modeling, and security policies that enable all subsequent epics to inherit robust security-by-design principles while delivering a validated security baseline.

## Story 0.1: Project Security Foundation Setup

As a security-conscious development team,
I want to establish Nx/Turborepo + pnpm monorepo with SLSA compliance and SBOM generation,
so that our supply-chain is protected from compromise and we have verifiable build attestation.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Nx workspace configured with TypeScript, React Native, and Next.js applications
2. pnpm package manager configured with lockfile integrity checking and audit automation
3. SLSA Level 2 compliance implemented with build provenance attestation
4. SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) automatically generated for all dependencies
5. Sigstore integration for build artifact signing and verification
6. Dependency vulnerability scanning integrated into CI/CD pipeline
7. Package pinning strategy implemented with automated security updates

## Story 0.2: Comprehensive Threat Model Creation

As a privacy-focused product team,
I want to create a detailed threat model covering all attack vectors against menstrual health data,
so that security controls are systematically designed to mitigate identified risks.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. STRIDE analysis completed for all system components (mobile, web, backend, crypto)
2. Privacy threat assessment specific to reproductive health data sensitivity
3. Attack tree analysis for key scenarios: device compromise, network interception, server breach
4. Regulatory threat analysis (government access, legal compulsion scenarios)
5. Social engineering and UI-based attacks documented (shoulder surfing, family access)
6. Threat model documentation updated in security wiki with regular review schedule
7. Risk acceptance decisions documented with rationale for each identified threat

## Story 0.3: Database Security Hardening

As a zero-knowledge architecture implementer,
I want Supabase RLS policies configured with "deny-by-default" principle,
so that data access is impossible without explicit user authorization.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. All database tables configured with RLS enabled and deny-by-default policies
2. User isolation policies preventing cross-user data access under any circumstance
3. Service role policies restricted to only non-PII operations (health checks, migrations)
4. Database connection security hardened with SSL/TLS and certificate pinning
5. Audit logging enabled for all database access attempts and policy violations
6. RLS policy testing suite with negative test cases (attempted unauthorized access)
7. Database encryption at rest verified with key management documented

## Story 0.4: Web Security Headers and CSP Implementation

As a web application security engineer,
I want comprehensive Content Security Policy, Subresource Integrity, and Trusted Types implemented,
so that client-side attacks and code injection are prevented.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Strict Content Security Policy implemented blocking all unauthorized script execution
2. Subresource Integrity (SRI) hashes for all external resources and dependencies
3. Trusted Types API implemented preventing DOM-based XSS attacks
4. HTTP security headers implemented (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options)
5. Certificate pinning configured for all external API communications
6. CSP reporting endpoint configured with violation monitoring and alerting
7. Security header testing automated in CI/CD with failure on policy violations

## Story 0.5: Security Gates Framework Implementation

As a development team lead,
I want automated security gates that validate crypto envelope structure and prevent PII leakage,
so that every epic meets consistent security standards before deployment.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Crypto envelope validation tests checking v/alg/kdf/salt/nonce/kid structure
2. Automated pcap analysis ensuring only encrypted payloads in network traffic
3. Property-based and fuzz testing framework integrated with CI/CD
4. Log analysis automation detecting any PII exposure in application logs
5. RLS policy testing automation with comprehensive unauthorized access attempts
6. SSR-PII prevention tests ensuring no sensitive data in server-side rendering
7. Security gate failure prevents merge/deployment with clear remediation guidance
