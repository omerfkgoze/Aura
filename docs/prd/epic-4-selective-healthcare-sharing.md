# Epic 4: Selective Healthcare Sharing

**Epic Goal:** Build libsignal-based encrypted sharing system with time-limited access controls, healthcare provider export capabilities supporting multiple formats, and privacy-safe audit logging that enables secure medical consultation while maintaining user data sovereignty.

## Story 4.1: libsignal Integration for Secure Sharing

As a user needing to share cycle data with healthcare providers,
I want libsignal-based encryption for sharing links with granular access controls,
so that I can securely share specific data without compromising my overall privacy.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. libsignal SDK integration with Double Ratchet protocol for forward secrecy
2. Time-limited sharing links with configurable expiration (hours, days, weeks)
3. Single-use link generation ensuring data access cannot be replayed
4. Scope-limited sharing allowing selection of specific data ranges and categories
5. Recipient authentication ensuring only intended healthcare providers access data
6. End-to-end encryption maintaining zero-knowledge architecture during sharing
7. libsignal protocol testing validating cryptographic properties and security guarantees

## Story 4.2: Healthcare Provider Data Export System

As a healthcare provider receiving patient cycle data,
I want standardized export formats including PDF, CSV, and FHIR schemas,
so that I can integrate menstrual health information into medical workflows and records.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. PDF export generation with medical-grade formatting and patient anonymization options
2. CSV export with standardized medical terminology and date formatting
3. FHIR R4 schema compliance for electronic health record integration
4. PII filtering ensuring exported data contains only medically relevant information
5. Export validation preventing inclusion of sensitive metadata or system information
6. Custom export templates allowing healthcare providers to specify required data fields
7. Export audit trail tracking what data was shared with which providers

## Story 4.3: Time-Limited Access Control System

As a user controlling access to my health data,
I want granular control over sharing duration and automatic revocation capabilities,
so that healthcare providers cannot retain access to my data beyond necessary consultation periods.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Configurable access duration with automatic link expiration and data access termination
2. Manual revocation capability allowing immediate termination of active sharing sessions
3. Access scope definition enabling sharing of specific date ranges or data categories only
4. Preview functionality showing exactly what data will be shared before link generation
5. Access notification system alerting users when shared data is accessed by providers
6. Bulk revocation allowing users to terminate all active sharing links simultaneously
7. Access control testing ensuring unauthorized access is impossible after expiration

## Story 4.4: Privacy-Safe Access Logging and Audit Trail

As a privacy-conscious user sharing health data,
I want detailed access logs that track data usage without compromising my privacy,
so that I can monitor how my shared information is being accessed and used.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Access logging recording when, how long, and which data sections were accessed
2. Privacy-safe logging ensuring log entries contain no sensitive health information
3. User-accessible audit dashboard showing sharing history and access patterns
4. Healthcare provider access confirmation showing successful data receipt
5. Anomaly detection identifying unusual access patterns or potential security issues
6. Log retention policies automatically purging old access records after defined periods
7. Audit trail integrity protection preventing log tampering or unauthorized modification

## Story 4.5: Revocation and Access Management Interface

As a user managing multiple healthcare sharing relationships,
I want centralized management of all active and expired sharing links,
so that I can maintain control over my data access permissions across different providers.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Centralized dashboard showing all active, expired, and revoked sharing links
2. Provider identification system allowing users to tag and organize sharing relationships
3. Bulk management operations for revoking multiple links or extending access periods
4. Access history visualization showing data usage patterns across different providers
5. Emergency revocation capability for immediate termination of all sharing activities
6. Sharing template system for quickly generating links with common provider requirements
7. Management interface testing ensuring users can effectively control all sharing aspects
