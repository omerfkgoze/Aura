## Top Issues by Priority

**MEDIUM Priority:**

- Data retention and deletion policies require more specification for GDPR compliance
- Healthcare provider onboarding process not fully defined
- Cross-platform testing strategy needs elaboration

**LOW Priority:**

- Additional user research validation would strengthen assumptions
- More detailed error recovery scenarios could be beneficial

## MVP Scope Assessment

- **Scope is Appropriate:** Features directly address core privacy-first menstrual tracking need
- **No Essential Features Missing:** All MVP requirements covered comprehensively
- **Complexity Well-Managed:** Advanced crypto implementation isolated in Epic 0-1, allowing iterative development
- **Timeline Realistic:** 6-month timeline achievable with proposed epic structure

## Technical Readiness

- **Excellent Technical Constraints:** Modern cryptographic standards with specific implementation guidance
- **Well-Identified Risks:** Supply-chain security and advanced crypto implementation flagged appropriately
- **Clear Architecture Direction:** Zero-knowledge architecture with Rust/WASM core provides solid foundation
- **Ready for Architect:** Sufficient detail for architectural design phase

## Recommendations

1. **Medium Priority:** Define detailed data retention policies for different data categories
2. **Low Priority:** Consider adding healthcare provider onboarding flow details
3. **Consider:** Schedule cryptographic architecture review with security specialist during Epic 1

## Final Decision

**READY FOR ARCHITECT**: The PRD is comprehensive, well-structured, and provides excellent technical guidance. The epic structure enables iterative development while maintaining security-first principles. Minor refinements can be addressed during implementation.
