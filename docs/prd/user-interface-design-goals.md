# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

Aura provides a privacy-adaptive interface that transforms from complete discretion (stealth mode) to comprehensive medical tracking based on user comfort level. The core UX principle is "privacy as user control" - every interface decision prioritizes user agency over data collection. The design emphasizes honest uncertainty in predictions through visual confidence intervals, building trust through transparency rather than false precision.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Privacy-First Navigation:** All sensitive data entry occurs behind privacy screens with quick-exit mechanisms
- **Stealth Mode Toggle:** Seamless switching between disguised interface (calculator/notes) and full tracking interface
- **Uncertainty Visualization:** Predictions displayed as probability ranges with color-coded confidence levels rather than specific dates
- **Offline-First Interactions:** All core functions accessible without network dependency, with clear indicators for cloud features

## Core Screens and Views

- **Stealth Mode Interface:** Calculator or notes app appearance with hidden access to tracking features
- **Cycle Dashboard:** Current cycle status with confidence-based predictions and privacy controls
- **Data Entry Screen:** Simple, discrete input for period dates, symptoms, and flow with quick-save functionality
- **Prediction View:** Visual timeline showing probability ranges for next periods with uncertainty indicators
- **Privacy Control Center:** Granular settings for data sharing, stealth mode, and encryption key management
- **Export Interface:** Healthcare provider sharing with time-limited access link generation

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

Full compliance with WCAG AA standards ensuring menstrual health tracking is accessible to users with disabilities. Special attention to screen reader compatibility for discrete tracking and high contrast modes that maintain stealth capabilities.

## Branding

Clean, medical-grade interface aesthetic that balances professionalism with approachability. Color palette avoids stereotypical "feminine" pink themes, instead using calming blues and greens that work in both stealth and full modes. Visual design should feel more like a secure banking app than a traditional health tracker to reinforce trust and privacy positioning.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Cross-platform responsive design prioritizing mobile-first experience while maintaining full functionality on desktop web. Interface must adapt gracefully from phone screens to tablets to desktop while preserving privacy controls and stealth capabilities across all form factors.
