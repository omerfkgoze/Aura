# Master Threat Prioritization Matrix

## Executive Summary

This document consolidates all threat assessments from the comprehensive threat model creation for the Aura reproductive health application. The master threat matrix prioritizes threats across all categories - STRIDE analysis, privacy-specific threats, attack trees, regulatory/legal risks, and UI/UX security threats - providing a unified implementation roadmap for systematic risk mitigation.

## Risk Scoring Methodology

**Comprehensive Risk Assessment Framework:**

- **Impact Scale:** 1-5 (1=Low, 5=Critical reproductive health data exposure)
- **Likelihood Scale:** 0.0-1.0 (based on attack complexity and attacker resources)
- **Risk Score:** (Impact × Likelihood × 100)
- **Cultural Amplification Factor:** 1.0-2.0 (applied to threats with cultural/social consequences)
- **Legal Amplification Factor:** 1.0-1.5 (applied to threats with regulatory consequences)

**Priority Thresholds:**

- **Critical (300+):** Immediate mitigation required (within 1 week)
- **High (150-299):** Mitigation within sprint (1-4 weeks)
- **Medium (50-149):** Mitigation within epic (1-3 months)
- **Low (1-49):** Monitor and document (ongoing)
