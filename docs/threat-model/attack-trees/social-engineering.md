### Risk Assessment

**Critical Risk Paths:**

1. **Parental Authority Claim → Medical Emergency Access** (Overall Probability: 0.35, Impact: Critical)
2. **Partner Surveillance → Shared Device Justification** (Overall Probability: 0.36, Impact: Critical)

**Mitigations:**

- Age verification and parental consent management
- Domestic violence awareness and protection measures
- Multi-factor family verification processes
- Cultural sensitivity training for support staff
- Anonymous reporting mechanisms for coercion

### Risk Scoring Summary

| Attack Vector                                 | Max Risk Score | Primary Mitigation                              | Implementation Priority |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Partner Surveillance via Shared Device**    | 360            | Stealth mode + biometric auth                   | Critical                |
| **Parental Authority for Minor Access**       | 350            | Age verification + consent management           | Critical                |
| **Support Impersonation via Domain Spoofing** | 288            | Email authentication + verification             | High                    |
| **Account Recovery via OSINT**                | 268.8          | Multi-channel verification + security questions | High                    |
| **Family Emergency Access Claims**            | 280            | Emergency protocols + verification              | High                    |

### Implementation Recommendations

**Critical Priority (Immediate):**

1. **Family Protection Controls**
   - Stealth mode with disguised interfaces
   - Biometric authentication requirements
   - Emergency data hiding mechanisms
   - Domestic violence protection protocols

2. **Age Verification and Consent**
   - Robust age verification processes
   - Parental consent management system
   - Minor protection protocols
   - Legal compliance framework

3. **Communication Authentication**
   - DMARC/DKIM/SPF enforcement
   - Official channel verification systems
   - Multi-channel authentication for sensitive requests
   - Impersonation detection training

**High Priority (Within Sprint):**

1. **Account Recovery Security**
   - Multi-layered identity verification
   - OSINT-resistant security questions
   - Cooling-off periods for sensitive changes
   - Recovery request anomaly detection

2. **Support Process Hardening**
   - Staff social engineering awareness training
   - Customer verification protocols
   - Escalation procedures for sensitive requests
   - Support interaction logging and monitoring

**Medium Priority (Within Epic):**

1. **Cultural Awareness Training**
   - Staff cultural sensitivity training
   - Multi-cultural support protocols
   - Community resource partnerships
   - Cultural threat awareness documentation

2. **Advanced Threat Detection**
   - Behavioral analytics for social engineering attempts
   - Communication pattern analysis
   - Cross-channel threat correlation
   - Automated social engineering detection

This comprehensive social engineering analysis provides systematic threat modeling for human-factor attacks, with special emphasis on the unique vulnerabilities present in reproductive health applications, including family dynamics, cultural pressures, and relationship-based threats.
